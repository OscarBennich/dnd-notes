[[A History of Tal’Dorei]]:
- It has also been noted by prominent abyssal researchers that the use of demons by [[Trist Drassig|King Trist]] in the Battle of the Umbra Hills caused such a stir in the depths of the Abyss that it subsequently drew the attention of several demon princes to this region of Tal’Dorei, among them [[Graz’zt the Demon Prince of Pleasure ]]and [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]].

Known by various names including the *Blood Lord* and the *Shadow That Was*, Orcus is worshipped by the undead and by living creatures that channel the power of the undead. He is brooding and nihilistic and wants to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness under his control. 

Creator of ghouls and ghasts. Various texts on the subject state that Orcus created ghouls from an elf worshipper, Doresain, that turned on his own people and feasted on humanoid flesh. The gods took pity on Doresain when he tried to escape the Abyss after Orcus abandoned him, and since then elves have been immune to ghouls’ paralytic touch. Ghasts are ghouls that have been infused with more abyssal energy.

He is described as a foul and corpulent creature with a humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease and the decaying head that sits atop it holds glowing red eyes. On his back there are great black bat wings, stirring reeking air as he moves. Legends say that he wields a weapon called the Wand of Orcus - a mace-like rod topped by a humanoid skull, although the powers of this weapon are unknown.
