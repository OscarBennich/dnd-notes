- Eldest son of [[Warren Drassig]]
- He became known as “Neminar the Black-Fingered” as his forays into necromancy left one arm withered and tainted.
- He introduced tactics and magic that drove his soldiers beyond what he considered to be human “limitations”, leaving their bodies altered and mutated by necromancy. Their warped minds craved bloodshed, and their bodies needed no sustenance to fuel their bloodlust.
