[[A History of Tal’Dorei]]:
- It has also been noted by prominent abyssal researchers that the use of demons by [[Trist Drassig|King Trist]] in the Battle of the Umbra Hills caused such a stir in the depths of [[The Abyss]] that it subsequently drew the attention of several demon princes to this region of Tal’Dorei, among them [[Graz’zt the Demon Prince of Pleasure ]]and [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]].
