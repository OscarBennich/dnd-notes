[[Session 42]]
- During the [[Big Ball]] a trio of [[Matron of Ravens]] priestesses suddenly appeared
- They also want to give their blessing, this is *highly unusual*
- One of them hold a very ominous speech:
	- *May the Matron guide us in our time of need,
	  May she comfort the weary wandering soul,
	  For chains that bind in shadow and greed,
	  Are breaking down below.
	  Darkness will fall upon these lands,
	  As those that slept now greet the moon,
	  The few must act as my hands, to cleanse the rot that feeds the storm*
- Next steps:
	- Ask my [[Patron]]
	- Research in the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
	- Go back to the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]]
