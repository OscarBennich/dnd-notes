- Dain was killed by a [[Chuul]] that we fought as part of the quest to [[Clear the north road from monsters]] ([[Session 2]])
- We need to find a way to resurrect him!
- Maybe we can find a way to do it in [[Stilben]]?
---
- In the [[Stilben - Temple of Avandra|temple of Avandra]] we talked to [[Ashbrittle Nadderwater]] and found out that we need a [[Diamond]] worth at least 500g
- We need to find someone who can perform her duties for a day so she can perform the ritual
- Maybe we can get a diamond from the black market?
- We can keep Dain's body in [[Kenwynn]]'s cellar
- [[DnD/Campaign - 'Chip and The Groundbounds'/NPCs/Stilben/Lustran Zeth]] could have a diamond...
- We talked to [[Father Mordec Vart]] and he is willing to help us after the [[Ashbrittle Nadderwater|high priestess]] has performed the resurrection by performing the temple duties for 1 day
- A shipment of diamonds is arriving, but they are promised to the baron
- [[Hans Brask]] is supposed to collect the diamond but has promised it to [[DnD/Campaign - 'Chip and The Groundbounds'/NPCs/Stilben/Lustran Zeth]] but is willing to sell it to us for 725g
- We need to arrive at dawn (important!)
- Steal the diamond from the warehouse?
- Steal the diamond from the ship?
### The heist
- Plan A: 
	- Steal the diamond from the warehouse
	- Deliver it to the temple
	- Attempt to buy the diamond
		- We can't
		- We go to the inn
		- Work for a day
- Plan B:
	- The heist fails
	- Heist crew flees, either to [[Kenwynn]]'s house or the swamp depending on if people are following them
	- [[Evan|Me]] and [[Chip]] to attempt to buy it from [[Hans Brask]]
	- After we have the diamond we will deliver it directly to [[Ashbrittle Nadderwater]] who will perform the resurrection
	- Then we go to [[Sunset Stride Inn]] and work for a day

Questions:
- Do we need to figure out a place to meet outside of town?
- We were supposed to take care of the [[Sunset Stride Inn]] while [[Father Mordec Vart]] helps Ashbrittle, will that still be possible?
---
- [[Ossian]] and [[Narissa]] head to the [[Stilben - Temple of Avandra|temple]] to warn [[Ashbrittle Nadderwater]] that we are delivering the body (of [[Dain]])
- [[Chip]] picked up Dain's body and flew it over to the temple, through the big hole in the temple roof
- [[Cubert Crantock]] went to the harbor to look for the ship on which the diamond is set to arrive
- Me, Narissa, Ossian, and Mads head to the harbor / the warehouse to begin the heist
- I took a position far away from the warehouse to keep watch
- If shit hits the fan, I need to inform Chip
- The from [[Gray Bag of Tricks]] we got a Giant Rat:
  
```statblock
creature: Giant Rat
```

and a Giant Badger:

```statblock
creature: Giant Badger
```

- [[Ossian]] commanded the creatures to distract the guards
- Narissa, Ossian, and Mads start breaking in to the warehouse
- The rat starts attacking the guards
- The badger screams to distract the guards
	- It doesn't go well... (roll 4)
- The rat gets killed by one of the guards and disappeared but [[Griffongrease|the grease]] stayed
- There was a small figure in the warehouse
- Narissa managed to remove a glass pane
- The figure is no longer visible
- Narissa and Ossian climbs inside with the help of the rope
- They start searching for the diamond
- Two additional guards show up to the warehouse
- They go and find the badger and attack him
- Narissa finds a box
	- She opens it
	- A powder spreads into the air
	- She takes 1 dmg
	- Underneath a hidden velvet panel is **the diamond we've been looking for**
- Narissa notices something shifting behind a shelf
	- A head pops up, a small figure
	- Goggles, a scarf, and old-fashioned pilot's hat
- He jumped up on a crate, threw a coin and then ran away
- Narissa takes a look at the coin before leaving
- Narissa and Ossian climb back out of the warehouse
- Because of bad stealth rolls, the guards come back to check out the window
- Ossian uses the [[Gray Bag of Tricks]] to summon a Boar:

```statblock
creature: Boar
```

- All 3 run away
- Ossian rolls a Nat 1 on stealth but manages to get away through a clever move
- The guards fight the boar as Ossian, Mads, and Narissa manage to leave undetected
- As I see Ossian leaving, I leave too
- [[Session 6]]: The rest of the party head to the temple to begin the ritual
- Ossian, Narissa, and Mads attempt to contribute to the ritual
- We thought the ritual might have failed but all of the sudden he wakes up (roll 8 on a DC 8 check!)
- [[Dain]] is alive again! ðŸ¥³
- Quest complete âœ…
