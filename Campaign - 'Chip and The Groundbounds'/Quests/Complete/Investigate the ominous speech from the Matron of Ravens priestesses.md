[[Session 42]]
- During the [[Big Ball]] a trio of [[Matron of Ravens]] priestesses suddenly appeared
- They also want to give their blessing, this is *highly unusual*
- One of them hold a very ominous speech:
	- *May the Matron guide us in our time of need,
	  May she comfort the weary wandering soul,
	  For chains that bind in shadow and greed,
	  Are breaking down below.
	  Darkness will fall upon these lands,
	  As those that slept now greet the moon,
	  The few must act as my hands, to cleanse the rot that feeds the storm*
- Next steps:
	- Ask my [[Patron]]
	- Research in the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
	- Go back to the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]]

[[Session 44]]
- (Religion check) - going to the Cobalt Reserve won't help
- [[Narissa]], Chip, and I will go to the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]]
- We head out in the city
- There's a surprisingly good atmosphere - it is the first day of the [[Midsummer Festival]]
- Some people are talking about the dragon attack
- It's being branded as an "accident" rather than an attack
- [[Chip]] is not convinced it wasn't actually an accident, because he has never seen fireworks before
- We go through the Residential Ward and get to the Temple Ward
- We enter the Temple
- We're all in the same room
- We see a familiar, tall, thin figure kneeling at the altar
- A single black raven feather lays in a bowl before her
- It is one of the people that gave the blessing at the [[Big Ball]]
- It's hard to tell them apart because they all look the same
- She turns and speaks to us - *Ah, the ones touched by thread and storm*
- We can hear form the voice that this is the person who spoke at the ball
- It seems like she is the only one here
- I tell her we want to speak to her about the speech
- The priestess says it was not she who spoke
- Priestess: *I dreamt of fields, blood, hands reaching up to the living sky...*
- Abruptly turns and leaves
- The room seems to extend behind the back wall (like an optical illusion)
- Another figure in white robes approaches - [[Mother Veyra]]
- She refers to the other figure as [[Mother Keres]] (the one who spoke at the Ball)
- She motions us to follow her behind the back wall - following [[Mother Keres]]
- The stone grows colder
- We enter into a small, candle-lit chamber with a blood-red carpet
- Another priestess: [[Mother Laima]]
- Narissa recounts the visions she had in the Temple before
- The Matron of Ravens has spoken through [[Mother Keres]] two times before
- Mother Veyra thinks we (specifically) have been chosen by the [[Matron of Ravens]] to be her champions
- She also talks about [[Lyrengorn]], that Narissa saw in her vision
	- There might be something waiting for us there?
- *The blood rain has been seen before by the members of the [[Claret Orders]]*
- These visions have been seen before times of great calamity
- Blood falling from the sky often heralds times of life and un-life
- [[Mother Veyra]] asks if our father might perhaps be part of the [[Claret Orders]]
- [[Lyrengorn]] is where we might find more answers
- She says she doesn't know what evil force the words from the Matron could be referring to
- As we're wrapping up, she casts *Death Ward* on [[Chip]]
- We leave the temple
- Quest complete âœ…
