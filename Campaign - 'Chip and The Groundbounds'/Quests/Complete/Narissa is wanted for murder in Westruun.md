[[Session 8]]:
- From [[Madame Saunton]]: 
	- _Warning_! Intense interest in locating Narissa. Stay out of [[The Clasp]]'s strongholds.
- Why did they think Narissa did it?
- Who was the guy who broke in with Narissa?
- And was he high-up in the Clasp? Otherwise why would they be going after her so much?

[[Session 12]]:
- Narissa says she did not commit the crime while affected by a _Zone of Truth_ (so she must be telling the truth)

[[Session 22]]

- Shepherd's name is *Jack* - [[Jack Shepherd]]
- [[The Spireling]]

[[Session 34]]
- More info about [[Steppen Wolfe]]
- [[Jack Shepherd]] has tried to find Narissa to resolve the situation for two reasons:
	- He was close to Steppen 
	- He is also a companion to [[Bess]], whose employee was driven out of the city because she looked like Narissa

- [[Narissa]] dreams
- She sees a thread of fate - her own
- She walks backwards through the thread, back in history

	- What was he trying to steal? Why?
- Apparently there was a 3rd person with Steppen and Jack that went by the name of "J"

[[Session 37]]
- We are attacked by 4x Cutthroats after visiting [[Westhall Academy]]
- The main guy has a tattoo from [[The Clasp]] on his back
- We try to interrogate the guy we saw run away
- He was told by [[The Clasp]] to "bring us in" because we've pissed them off?
- He'll pass on a message that we want to see them
- In [[Doom Bar]] we ask [[John Christ]]  if he ever goes by "J" - he answers *No*
- John tells us that [[Jude Christ]] can sometimes be found drinking at [[The Cleric's Finger]]
- We head there instead
- We ask him about [[Steppen Wolfe]] and [[Jack Shepherd]]
- We head to [[Bessie's Best]] in the Underwalk to talk to [[Bess]] about "J"
- [[Ofelia]] tell us that "J" is actually [[John Christ]]
- John was lying about the diamond thing!

[[Session 38]]

- We go to the Underwalk and look for John
- We go into the sewers
- We turn a corner and see [[John Christ]] being held up by his neck by a humanoid with a rats head
- It's a [[Wererat]]
- We succeed and kill all the rats!
- We interrogate John
- He didn't know [[Jack Shepherd]] well?
- He doesn't want [[Billiam Christ]] involved
- [[Steppen Wolfe]] was a operative for [[The Myriad]] inside [[The Clasp]]
- John was Steppen's handler, so he is also from [[The Myriad]]
- "The Clasp is getting sloppy"
- [[Jack Shepherd]] was not part of [[The Myriad]]
- ~ 9 months ago Steppen talked about a [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] in [[Westruun]]
- Who bought the shop?
- He was sharing info until a point
- Steppen thought he would come into money?
- The shop had a connection to [[The Clasp]]? But he couldn't connect it.
- Steppen was going to the [[Hall of Reason]] to look through the archives and find out who owned the shop
	- It was previously owned by [[Feena]]
	- Who owned it after?
- John doesn't know how [[Narissa]] got involved
- He doesn't know if [[The Myriad]] was involved in pinning it on her
- **We should investigate the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]**
- John doesn't know how Steppen got killed either
- He tells us the diamond (that we used to resurrect [[Dain]] in [[Stilben]]) was supposed to go to [[Lustran Zeth]]
- John had asked The Myriad to get him out of the city and was lying low (in the sewers)
- The [[Wererat]] has reverted to human form after dying
	- He has a tattoo from [[The Clasp]]
- We come to an agreement with John that we won't tell Billiam if he doesn't tell The Myriad about us

[[Session 39]]
- Was [[Steppen Wolfe]] killed to protect the identity of whoever owned/owns the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] (took it over after [[Feena]])

- We go to parlay in the Market Ward after getting a note in [[Doom Bar]]
- Eventually we find the parlay symbol on a warehouse
- It's now 11PM
- The warehouse is big and dark
- We chose to wait inside
- As we step inside, magical lanterns light up
- 2 guards show up out of nowhere
- A figure sits on a "throne of sorts" - flanked by 2 guards
- He's wearing a navy blue, extravagant, ogre mask
- It's [[The Spireling]]!
- He tells us that [[Steppen Wolfe]]'s body was taken by [[The Shields]]
- We talk to him and try to convince him we/Narissa didn't kill Steppen
- 6 more heavily-armed guards appear out of the shadows
- **We promise him to drop the matter - otherwise he would kill us**
- [[Patron]] decision 1/3: 
	- Go to the [[Hall of Reason]] and get the records for the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] as soon as possible
	- Buy the [[Hat of Disguise]] from  [[Gilmore's Glorious Goods]]

[[Session 40]]
- Me and Narissa (using a disguise kit) head to the [[Hall of Reason]]
- We fill out a form to get access to the back room
- [[Ethel Braithwait]] - civil servant in the [[Hall of Reason]]
- Ethel lets us into the room that Narissa tried breaking into with [[Steppen Wolfe]]
- I cast *Detect Magic* w/ sleight of hand (to not be detected)
- The room has a ward and it seems connected to the medallion that Ethel has on her
- Abjuration school
- I cast *Identify*
- It's a 4th level *Alarm* spell
- Ethel escorts us out
- She is suspicious of me
- [[Hall of Reason]] heist plan:
	1. Go to brothel in Underwalk to fool followers from [[The Clasp]]
	2. The whole party leave and go to the [[Hall of Reason]] with 4th level *Invisibility* from Ossian, and *Pass without Trace* from Mads
	3. Gets inside (??)
	4. Dispel the alarm spell on the door
	5. Look for he documents about the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]
- We start the heist plan
- Chip summons a *Giant Elk* from the [[Gray Bag of Tricks]] as a distraction
- We get into the main hall through lockpicking the main door
- I dispel the *Alarm* spell and we get inside the records room
- [[Chip]] keeps a lookout at the door and we search for the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] documents
- Eventually we find the correct drawer **but the documents aren't there**
- Any owner after [[Feena]] is gone!
- We hear voices outside the door
- We bar the door, break the window and escape
- We also manage to steal another document from the record room to make it seem like we weren't there for the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]
- Next steps:
	- Break into the leatherworker shop that the Herbalist shop became to see if there's more info there?

[[Session 45]]
- Narissa, Chip, and I scout out the Leatherworking store during the day
- We plan to break into the leatherworking store during the night
- I cast *Seeming* on the group (we all look like our IRL selves)
- We wait another hour so I get my spell slot back
- Mads casts *Pass without Trace* on us
- We go to the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]
- I cast *Detect Magic* (10 min)
- Chip makes a perception check (29) - he sees through a small gap in the curtain on the second floor, a flicker of light and a shadow passing by
- I sense magic on the first floor, where I saw the magic when we were inside the building during the day and one more spot (Tristan's medallion probably). But none for the door to the second story
- We move to lockpick the door to the first floor
- Narissa rolls a 42 (!!) on Stealth 🥷
- Narissa picks the lock to the first floor (check = 25)
- We go inside
- [[Ossian]] casts *Invisibility* on himself
- Chip makes a *Perception* check (18)
- I see some papers on the work bench, *Investigation* check, they turn out to be nothing, but I also see a locked drawer
- Narissa picks the lock
- She finds a "Ledger of Transactions" in the drawer
- There is one item in the ledger that occurs regularly, ~ once per month, called "Additional shop loan payments", on top of his normal loan payments
- If Tristan was paying this type of money, he should have less money total, it doesn't add up. But the money he gets is also paid out again...
	- *Money laundering*?
- We go into the living quarters behind the work bench
- It is a room in front of Tristan's bedroom
- We smell a dank smell of earth and decay. *A basement?*
- The magical signature is pointing to a painting on the wall
	- The painting is of a seascape - it reminds Mads of [[Feena]]
- There is also a very feint magical signature is also coming from a half-dead plant in the corner
	- Some kind of residue of magic - difficult to place
	- It's leaves have turned an unnatural black
- The smell was coming from this plant
- Chip makes a WIS saving throw - his hand is drawn forward to the plant, he pricks his finger and blood is drawn
- Everyone in the room hears the same vision:
	- "I told you girl, you should have sold."
	- The scent of earth and damp air fills the room
	- "Do it! [[The Spireling]] says no loose ends."
	- "As you wish."
	- The slash of steel, a cry of pain - [[Feena]]'s
- An aural vision of Feena's murder it seems, somehow triggered by touching the thorny plant in the room
- After the vision, the plant crumbles into dust except one thorn - it now bears the mark of [[The Clasp]]

[[Session 46]]
- Mads reaches out and touches the painting, it swings open and behind it is a hatch. Like a safe?
- Mads tries to open the hatch and triggers the *Glyph of Warding*
- We all make an INT saving throw
	- *Psychic* and *Abjuration* magic
- We all suffer from *Psychic Overload*
- We all take 23 damage and are stunned for the next minute
- Me, Chip, and Mads all hear whispers and we see 3 ghostly apparitions (basically dementors) that lean over us. Only we see these, not everyone.
	- *We failed the INT saving throw by more than 5*
- [[Tristan Stonesworn]] runs out of his bedroom and sees us
- He runs towards the hatch and opens the safe (we're all stunned)
	- Inside it seems to be some kind of pulley system
- He sticks his head inside and shouts "Help!"
- We roll another INT saving throw
	- Me, Mads, and Chip fail
	- Ossian, Dain, and Narissa succeed
- We roll initiative!
- Combat over...
- Mads pulls the unconscious Tristan away
- Chip tries to attack the apparition but it goes right through and hits me instead
	- 15 damage
- I make an Arcana check
- I cast *Detect Magic* on [[Mads]] and the apparition disappears on her
	- Chip and I still see ours
- I make an investigation check while looking up the chute
- There's something like a dumbwaiter in the chute with a button to call it down
	- It can move between the store and upstairs
- Egged on by my [[Patron]] (and a self-imposed D20 roll) I press the button to call down the dumbwaiter
- I see no light in the chute, this probably means that the top "door" isn't open
- It comes down and inside is a folded up piece of parchment
- I pick it up and look at it but the text seems to just be gibberish
- [[Narissa]] looks at it and with an INT check she can tell it's some kind of code
	- We need the cipher to decipher the text
- Mads walks into Tristan's bedroom and looks around (Nat 20 investigation roll)
- There's a children's book on his bedside table and one hidden away (*"Tusk Love"*)
- Narissa makes an INT roll to figure out if *Tusk Love* contains the cipher but fails
- Mads throws a glass of water in Tristan's face and he wakes up
- Chip and Narissa start doing a "good cop, bad cop" routine
- Dain casts *Major Illusion* to summon a vision of [[The Spireling]]
	- Tristan doesn't seem to recognize him...
- Narissa asks him about the people upstairs and his transactions in the ledger
- Tristan: "Money goes in and out, I send it up"
- Insight check:
	- He doesn't seem to know more than he is telling
	- He seems to just be a middle-man
	- But he knows he is part of something criminal in one way or another
- Tristan: "I was told to purchase the premises. I got a letter one day. I didn't have the money so I had a guarantor."
	- The guarantor apparently came from the [[The League of Miracles]]
	- The League of Miracles were the one's who told him to purchase the shop
- He got the letter shortly after [[Feena]] was murdered
- We put the gag back on him and Narissa knocks him out again
- Narissa makes another INT roll to figure out if *Tusk Love* contains the cipher
	- It is not the right book
- Is [[The League of Miracles]] paying [[The Clasp]] money through the shop?
	- Why? What are they paying for?
	- And also, why did they need *this* shop specifically? Why did they kill [[Feena]] for it?
		- Maybe The Clasp already owned the location upstairs?
- We should go upstairs and look for:
	- A potential cipher to decode the letter
		- We suspect that it makes the most sense that [[Tristan Stonesworn]] wouldn't be involved in reading the letters, but just shuttle them back and forth through the dumbwaiter
	- Any information about why [[The Clasp]] are interested in the specific store
	- Any information binding The Clasp and [[The League of Miracles]]
- We start heading towards the staircase to go upstairs
- Narissa makes a history check, Nat 20!
	- She remembers hearing about "going upstairs" in shady dealings
	- Like having a huge debt etc., someone who is in trouble
	- Is "upstairs" like an info desk for [[The Clasp]] where you can make deals?
	  
> "Being Shrek'd"

* If we could find the deed that was stolen from the [[Hall of Reason]], then that would have the signature of the guarantor from [[The League of Miracles]] which would prove the connection
	* ✅ Find proof that the store is connected to [[The Clasp]]
	* ❌ Find proof that the store is connected to [[The League of Miracles]]
		* Decode the letter?
* We see a person going up and knocking on the door and then go inside, after a few minutes, the same person comes out again
* Narissa, Mads, and I go upstairs
	* We can use our [[Sending Stones]]
* Mads knocks on the door
* The room inside is dimly lit
* A heavy wooden table dominates the left side of the room. There are people playing cards around it. 3 people + the dealer. The dealer is facing us
	* We do not recognize anyone
* In front of us is a corridor that leads to a single black door, blocked by a screen door
* On the right side of the corridor is a door
	* Based on what we know of the layout, inside this room is where the dumbwaiter from downstairs should lead
* Near the threshold to the black door is what looks like an old blood stain on the floor
* Immediately to our right as we enter, is a desk with a half-orc woman
* She asks us "Are you expected, or are you looking for an introduction?"
* She closes a big book, a ledger of sorts?
* There's also a lithe Drow here, golden eyes that stare at us coldly
	* He seems to be a security guard of some kind
* The half-orc woman signs to the Drow and leads us down the corridor and to the black door
* Behind the black door is a room that is stained with more blood - interrogation room?
* We keep our eyes out for anything that could be used as a cipher
* The half-orc's name is [[Matga The Hammer]]
* We tell her we owe 1000g
	* She tells us we can either make a deal or play cards for it
* We tell her we'd prefer a deal, she temporarily leaves and comes back with the ledger
* She tells us they're looking for [[Jack Shepherd]] and they'll pay us 1000g (500g if he's dead)
* She asks us to sign, we sign as:
	* "*Pile Duncan*"
	* "*Noelle Duncan*"
	* "*Emma Fleetfoot*"
* On our way out, Matga talks to the Drow (calling him [[Varys]]). We all recognize his voice - it's the same voice that killed [[Feena]] in the vision we had downstairs
* We leave, meet up with the rest of the party and go back to [[Doom Bar]]
* Our apparitions have disappeared (after 1 hour)
	* After thinking about it (INT check) we don't think it makes sense that the decoding would occur "upstairs" so there's no point in going back there
	* We should look in the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]] instead
* Merged into [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp]] 🔀
