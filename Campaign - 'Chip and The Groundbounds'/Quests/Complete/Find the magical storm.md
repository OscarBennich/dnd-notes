- [[Chip]] was sent to [[Tal'Dorei]] to find this magical storm
- It is somehow connected to a threat to the world
- [[Eebah]] had a vision about the storm

[[Session 7]]
- More storms north of here ([[Stilben]]), towards [[Drynna]]

[[Session 8]]
- From [[Madame Saunton]]: Bad weather around [[Drynna]]

[[Session 15]]
* [[Chip]] asks around the camp about magical storms

[[Session 29]]
- [[Chip]] and I research the storm at the [[Cobalt Reserve]] (nat 20, 25 total)
- [[Melora]] hates anything that goes against nature
- "Druidic sites" - tome
- "On the blessing of the dawn"
- Hanging gardens of [[Shadebarrow]]
	- East of [[Gatshadow]]
	- Became druid worshippers tomb?
- *Temple of the Wildmother* in [[Westruun]] might know more
- Something happened to this [[Shadebarrow]] place to "piss off" Melora? Therefore creating a literal or metaphorical storm
- (1) Find out more info from the [[Westruun - Temple of Melora]] in Westruun
- (2) **Find Shadebarrow to investigate**

[[Session 31]]
- Chip, [[Dain]], and [[Evan|me]] head to the Temple of Melora
- We talk to someone at the temple and ask about [[Shadebarrow]]
	- [[Druids of the Dawn Circle]]
	- There was an old king - [[Trist Drassig]]
	- Shadebarrow become a burial ground for the druids
	- It was later owned by trade unions before being purchased by [[Sevil Howthess]] at great cost
	- He outfitted his tomb with riches
	- Now, no one knows where the tomb is
	- Adventuring parties sometimes look for it
- He asks me and Dain to leave so he can speak to Chip
- Descendants of the baron might know the location of [[Shadebarrow]]
	- [[Camilla Tenver]]
	- [[Buddleah Austan]]
- His name is [[Simon Cloudfang]]
- "Storms" that corrupt nature **could** refer to something like hoards of undead (what Narissa saw in the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]])

[[Session 36]]
- [[Meg Ruddlestone]] tells us how she was travelling from [[Drynna]] to [[Westruun]], in the forest somewhere. Undead things came towards her, then she died?
- She doesn't know why
- Not connected to a God seemingly
- I cast *Detect Magic* but there's no magic on her
- **How was she turned**?
- Could this be connected to the Tomb in [[Shadebarrow]]?
- She says there is "undead stuff" happening on the plains
- She knows she was east of [[Gatshadow]] and south of the road

[[Session 44]]
- Chip asks [[Mother Veyra]] in the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]] about the storm
- She also thinks that it could **refer to an army of undead**
- Chip: *Thank you, I love you.*
- I ask her about people being turned undead ([[Meg Ruddlestone]])
- She tells us of her brother who was turned undead, but he seems to have been more of a zombie
- She says that if someone was turned undead but kept their "soul", the Matron might have a reason for it
- I think the "storm" is whatever is happening at [[Shadebarrow]]
- Merged into [[Main Quest - Investigate Shadebarrow]] ðŸ”€
