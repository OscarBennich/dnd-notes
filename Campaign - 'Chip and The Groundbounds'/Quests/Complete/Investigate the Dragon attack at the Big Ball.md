[[Session 42]]
- A two-headed green dragon was conjured during a fireworks display during the [[Big Ball]]

[[Session 43]]
- After it was defeated (by the Golem of [[Palest Westruun]]) it disappeared into thin air
- Who conjured it?
- And why?
- Research in the [[Cobalt Reserve]]?
- [[The Grand Thaumaturge]] has the ability to conjure [[Atronach]]s, is that a lead?
	- We also had the attack from the [[Nullifier]] in the [[Chianfanelli Bank]] vault
	- Are both of these attacks connected to [[The League of Miracles]]?
- [[Chip]], [[Mads]], [[Narissa]] investigate the area around [[Margrave's Keep]] for clues, any traces of components
- Whoever did it would have had to be close to the front of the party or just outside - tip from Mads
	- Chip flies around looking, initially finding nothing. He increases the search area.
		- He finds a copper coin, a mitten, and a pebble
		- He finds a singed scrap of paper in an alley
			- Arcana check (6): It looks weird
			- Arcana check (23): It looks like *Spell Scroll Paper*
			- I cast *Identify* on the paper
			- The paper gives off the same "signature" as the scale
	- [[Theo]] is also flying around looking, but doesn't find anything
- I try to figure out what kind of magic could have conjured something like this
	- Arcana check (17): I know that if I cast *Identify* I would be able to figure out more info
	- I cast *Identify* on a dragon scale on the ground
	- The spell that has been cast **doesn't have a name**
		- It is a mixture of conjuration and transmutation
		- Very unique, experimental, magic that I haven't encountered before
		- Very tailor-made spell
	- I reach out to my [[Patron]]
		- She doesn't know either (or at least she says so)
		- "I have a touch of the Fey. This isn't Fey."
		- "Learned Wizards, experimenting..."
		- "It would be interesting to know *why*"
- Maybe find and talk to [[Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien]]?
	- We saw him talking to the [[Headmistress Estella Ladimar]] and interested in what [[Dominic]] was saying
	- He then left, somewhere (to his tower?)
- [[Finley Merrymeat]] asks me about what I identified
- [[Zenor]] looks worried when I tell them what I found
- [[Mads]] and [[Chip]] leave to track whoever left the scrap of paper
- Chip rides [[Theo]] - Animal handling check (Nat 20)
- They look for traces of ash like the one from the paper
- They head down a street in the direction of the Residential Ward
- Escalating survival checks
- It seems like the person looped back around and started going *back* to the Market Ward
- Survival checks: 21 + 23 (DC 17)
- Walking deeper into the Market Ward
- Survival checks: 14 + 21 (DC 20)
- They see scuff marks and tracks, now they're heading back *again* to the Opal Ward
- Survival checks: 16 + 25 (DC 25)
- They follow the tracks to a building on the edge of the Market Ward, bordering the Opal Ward
- It's the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]!
- Merged into [[Find a connection between The League of Miracles and The Clasp]] ðŸ”€
