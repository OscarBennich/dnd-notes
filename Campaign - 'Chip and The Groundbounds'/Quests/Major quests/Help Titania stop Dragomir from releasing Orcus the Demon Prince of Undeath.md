[[Session 48]]
- My patron told me that what she wants from me is to stop [[Dragomir Lunthak]] from releasing [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]
- The reason is because one of the [[Druids of the Dawn Circle]] that Orcus killed in [[Shadebarrow]] "belonged" to her
- *If* Dragomir were to succeed, we need to figure out a way to kill and/or stop Orcus instead
