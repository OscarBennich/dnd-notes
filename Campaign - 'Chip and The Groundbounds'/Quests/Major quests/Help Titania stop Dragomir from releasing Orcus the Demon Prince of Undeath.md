[[Session 48]]
- My patron told me that what she wants from me is to stop [[Dragomir Lunthak]] from releasing [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]
- The reason is because one of the [[Druids of the Dawn Circle]] that Orcus killed in [[Shadebarrow]] "belonged" to her
- *If* Dragomir were to succeed, we need to figure out a way to kill and/or stop Orcus instead

[[Session 49]]
- *Titania*:
	- The creature Dragomir seeks to unleash is a Demon Prince of Undeath, if you stop him he remains imprisoned
	- If he succeeds you will be fighting a being that does not call this plane home, and can only be killed on it's own plane
	- Dragomir is not directly responsible for the undead army around [[Shadebarrow]], but [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] is but as Dragomir is trying to free him from the pocket dimension he is currently in, the undead presence is increasing

[[Session 50]]
- We fight [[Dragomir Lunthak]] in his house
- He managed to escape using *Teleport*
- We don't know where he went
