- [[The League of Miracles]]
- [[The Clasp]]
- From [[Billiam Christ]] in [[Westruun]]
---
- Debt is being used as leverage against the council
- If the league has ties to the Clasp it would make them outright illegal
- This would be evidence that the league is a criminal organization
- Billiam wants this for the good of [[Westruun]] (is that true?)
- We need to be discrete
- 2 paths:
- (1) Go through the clasp tavern in the Market Ward (HQ? Cover?)
- (2) Go through the league
	- There's going to be a [[Big Ball]] in a week or two
	- Billiam can get us in
	- At the [[Lysandra Kalloss]]'s house
	- [[Gilmore]] might be at the ball
	- We need to get expensive clothes so we can blend in
	- [[Simon Cloudfang]] might be at the ball too
	- Could [[Buddleah Austan]] be there as well?

[[Session 34]]
- Prominent members of [[The League of Miracles]] will be at the [[Big Ball]]

[[Session 42]]
- [[Mads]], [[Narissa]], and [[Dain]] go speak to [[Buddleah Austan]]
- She has some *suspicions* regarding the woman in the woods and [[Dragomir Lunthak]]
- She doesn't want to discuss it during the party but we're welcome to come by [[House Austan]] and speak to her
- Next steps:
	- [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]] ðŸ†•
	- Go to the offices of [[The League of Miracles]] in [[Westruun]] and see what we can find there'
	- Go back to the grave of the [[Investigate Bramblewood woman wandering outside of town|woman in the woods]] and use *Speak with Dead* to figure out more info about Lunthak
		- Her body has probably been taken by [[The Shields]] though...
