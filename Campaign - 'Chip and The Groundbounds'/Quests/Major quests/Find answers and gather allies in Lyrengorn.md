### Background
- After visiting the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens|Twilit temple]], [[Narissa]] had a vision/dream. This vision included our father's face between two peaks and blood rain falling from the sky (see [[Session 36]]). Those two peaks have to be referring to [[Lyrengorn]].
- When going back to the temple in [[Session 44]], we heard [[Mother Keres]] say *I dreamt of fields, blood, hands reaching up to the living sky...* (potentially the [[Matron of Ravens]] speaking through her).
- Narissa also told [[Mother Veyra]] about her vision and she thinks we (specifically) have been chosen by the [[Matron of Ravens]] to be her champions. She thinks there might be something waiting for us in Lyrengorn.
- The [[Investigate the ominous speech from the Matron of Ravens priestesses|ominous speech from the Matron of Ravens priestesses]] in [[Session 42]] also seems related to this:
	- *May the Matron guide us in our time of need,
	  May she comfort the weary wandering soul,
	  For chains that bind in shadow and greed,
	  Are breaking down below. 
	  Darkness will fall upon these lands,
	  As those that slept now greet the moon,
	  **The few must act as my hands, to cleanse the rot that feeds the storm** ðŸ‘ˆ
- She also told us about the fact that the blood rain has been seen before by the members of the [[Claret Orders]].
- She says these visions have been seen before times of great calamity, blood falling from the sky often heralds times of life and un-life.
- She also asked if [[Elluin Valfir|mine and Narissa's father]] could perhaps be part of the [[Claret Orders]]?
	- [[Perron]] that we met in [[Drynna]] might also be part of the Claret Orders as she seemed to be a [[Blood Hunter]].
- We also know [[Camilla Tenver]], one of two living descendent of [[Sevil Howthess]] together with [[Buddleah Austan]], might be in Lyrengorn after reading about it in a book from the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
