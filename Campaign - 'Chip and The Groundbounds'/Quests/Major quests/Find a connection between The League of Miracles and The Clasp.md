- [[The League of Miracles]]
- [[The Clasp]]
- From [[Billiam Christ]] in [[Westruun]]
	- The quest is *actually* from [[Lysandra Kalloss]] (indirectly)
	- Because she suspects that there are people on the [[Council of Westruun]] involved and she doesn't want them to know
---
- Debt is being used as leverage against the council
- If The League has ties to the Clasp it would make them outright illegal
- This would be evidence that the league is a criminal organization
- Billiam wants this for the good of [[Westruun]] (is that true?)
- We need to be discrete
- 2 paths:
	- (1) Go through the Clasp tavern in the Market Ward (HQ? Cover?)
		- [[The Saddled Plainscow]]
	- (2) Go through the league
		- There's going to be a [[Big Ball]] in a week or two
		- Billiam can get us in
		- At the [[Lysandra Kalloss]]'s house
		- [[Gilmore]] might be at the ball
		- We need to get expensive clothes so we can blend in
		- [[Simon Cloudfang]] might be at the ball too
		- Could [[Buddleah Austan]] be there as well?

[[Session 34]]
- Prominent members of [[The League of Miracles]] will be at the [[Big Ball]]

[[Session 42]]
- [[Mads]], [[Narissa]], and [[Dain]] go speak to [[Buddleah Austan]]
- She has some *suspicions* regarding the woman in the woods and [[Dragomir Lunthak]]
- She doesn't want to discuss it during the party but we're welcome to come by [[House Austan]] and speak to her
- Next steps:
	- [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]] ðŸ†•
	- Go to the offices of [[The League of Miracles]] in [[Westruun]] and see what we can find there
	- Go back to the grave of the [[Investigate Bramblewood woman wandering outside of town|woman in the woods]] and use *Speak with Dead* to figure out more info about Lunthak
		- Her body has probably been taken by [[The Shields]] though...

[[Session 43]]
- We found out that the tracks leading from the summoning of the dragon that attacked the [[Big Ball]] lead directly to the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]

[[Session 44]]
- [[Buddleah Austan]] told us she believed [[Dragomir Lunthak]] killed his servant [[Janet]] (even though she doesn't have proof) because Janet found something she shouldn't have and he tried to cover it up
- She also showed us a letter from [[Lila Lunthak]] to [[Hugh Austan]] in which she says she chose to leave Dragomir because he prioritized his "disgusting experiments" and that he is to blame for their daughters "fate"
	- Meaning he is to blame for [[Mads]] becoming a Tiefling?
- Were these experiments what [[Janet]] stumbled across?
- (see [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]])
- If Dragomir has hidden any evidence of these experiments in his office, we could use them to expose him and that might lead us to a connection between The League and The Clasp.

[[Session 45]]
- Different ways to infiltrate the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]
	- Speak to [[Honor Kinnabari]]
	- Utilize the fact that [[Mads]] is [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s daughter
	- Go into the offices during the day and then break in during the night
		- Utilize *Seeming* in some way?

[[Session 46]]
- See [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]]
	- [[Tristan Stonesworn]] told us that he was asked to purchase the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] from a letter that apparently came from [[The League of Miracles]]
- We should talk to [[Honor Kinnabari]] about what we found out about the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] and the connection to The League as well as the connection to the dragon attack (see [[Investigate the Dragon attack at the Big Ball]])
	- We think Honor would be interested in uncovering the truth, even if she works for The League
- We now *know* there is a connection between The Clasp and The League but we need some hard evidence to give to [[Billiam Christ]]
- The best thing would be if we could find the deed that was stolen from the [[Hall of Reason]], then that would have the signature of the guarantor from [[The League of Miracles]] which would prove the connection
