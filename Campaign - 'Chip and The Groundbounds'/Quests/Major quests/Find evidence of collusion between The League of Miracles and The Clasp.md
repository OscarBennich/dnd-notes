- [[The League of Miracles]]
- [[The Clasp]]
- From [[Billiam Christ]] in [[Westruun]]
	- The quest is *actually* from [[Lysandra Kalloss]] (indirectly)
	- Because she suspects that there are people on the [[Council of Westruun]] involved and she doesn't want them to know
---
- Debt is being used as leverage against the council
- If The League has ties to the Clasp it would make them outright illegal
- This would be evidence that the league is a criminal organization
- Billiam wants this for the good of [[Westruun]] (is that true?)
- We need to be discrete
- 2 paths:
	- (1) Go through the Clasp tavern in the Market Ward (HQ? Cover?)
		- [[The Saddled Plainscow]]
	- (2) Go through the league
		- There's going to be a [[Big Ball]] in a week or two
		- Billiam can get us in
		- At the [[Lysandra Kalloss]]'s house
		- [[Gilmore]] might be at the ball
		- We need to get expensive clothes so we can blend in
		- [[Simon Cloudfang]] might be at the ball too
		- Could [[Buddleah Austan]] be there as well?

[[Session 34]]
- Prominent members of [[The League of Miracles]] will be at the [[Big Ball]]

[[Session 42]]
- [[Mads]], [[Narissa]], and [[Dain]] go speak to [[Buddleah Austan]]
- She has some *suspicions* regarding the woman in the woods and [[Dragomir Lunthak]]
- She doesn't want to discuss it during the party but we're welcome to come by [[House Austan]] and speak to her
- Next steps:
	- [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]] ðŸ†•
	- Go to the offices of [[The League of Miracles]] in [[Westruun]] and see what we can find there
	- Go back to the grave of the [[Investigate Bramblewood woman wandering outside of town|woman in the woods]] and use *Speak with Dead* to figure out more info about Lunthak
		- Her body has probably been taken by [[The Shields]] though...

[[Session 43]]
- We found out that the tracks leading from the summoning of the dragon that attacked the [[Big Ball]] lead directly to the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]

[[Session 44]]
- [[Buddleah Austan]] told us she believed [[Dragomir Lunthak]] killed his servant [[Janet]] (even though she doesn't have proof) because Janet found something she shouldn't have and he tried to cover it up
- She also showed us a letter from [[Lila Lunthak]] to [[Hugh Austan]] in which she says she chose to leave Dragomir because he prioritized his "disgusting experiments" and that he is to blame for their daughters "fate"
	- Meaning he is to blame for [[Mads]] becoming a Tiefling?
- Were these experiments what [[Janet]] stumbled across?
- (see [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]])
- If Dragomir has hidden any evidence of these experiments in his office, we could use them to expose him and that might lead us to a connection between The League and The Clasp.

[[Session 45]]
- Different ways to infiltrate the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]
	- Speak to [[Honor Kinnabari]]
	- Utilize the fact that [[Mads]] is [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s daughter
	- Go into the offices during the day and then break in during the night
		- Utilize *Seeming* in some way?

[[Session 46]]
- See [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]]
	- [[Tristan Stonesworn]] told us that he was asked to purchase the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] from a letter that apparently came from [[The League of Miracles]]
- We should talk to [[Honor Kinnabari]] about what we found out about the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] and the connection to The League as well as the connection to the dragon attack (see [[Investigate the Dragon attack at the Big Ball]])
	- We think Honor would be interested in uncovering the truth, even if she works for The League
- We now *know* there is a connection between The Clasp and The League but we need some hard evidence to give to [[Billiam Christ]]
- The best thing would be if we could find the deed that was stolen from the [[Hall of Reason]], then that would have the signature of the guarantor from [[The League of Miracles]] which would prove the connection
---
**What do we know so far?**
- [[The League of Miracles]] has made a lot of money helping rebuild [[Westruun]] after the [[Chroma Crisis]].
	- Westruun still owes a considerable amount of money to The League for this. This debt is being used as leverage against the council.
- They have made an offer to the [[Council of Westruun]] to give Westruun additional protection (*see [[Session 43]]*). Apparently it is very expensive and the council has been reluctant to accept this offer.
	- This gives The League a clear incentive to intimidate Westruun and the Council into accepting this contact.
	- This is what they tried to do with the Dragon attack at the [[Big Ball]] (we know this was The League's doing because the magical traces lead back to [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]).
	- We also know that The League was involved in some way with the [[Nullifier]] in the [[Chianfanelli Bank]] as we found a note that said:
  
	  *"To be delivered to Cianfanelli Bank in Westruun and await collection by [[Dragomir Lunthak]]"*
  
	  (see [[Session 31]])
	- The Cianfanelli Bank also manages the debt that Westruun owes the League.
	- We also know there was an attack by Magma Landsharks in the Market Ward (*see [[Session 41]]*) but we don't have any evidence that The League where behind that (yet).
	- And the Night Hag ([[Luella the Dawnstealer]]) also mentioned knowing [[Mads]]' father (that we now know is [[Dragomir Lunthak]]). What does that mean?
- After investigating the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] (*see [[Session 46]] / [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]]*) and interrogating [[Tristan Stonesworn]], he confirmed multiple things:
	- [[The Clasp]] are behind the murder of [[Feena]] and did this because she refused to sell the shop to them.
	- Tristan was told through a letter to purchase the store after Feena was murdered. He didn't have the money so he had a guarantor who co-signed the deed. This person was from The League.
		- This is the deed that [[Steppen Wolfe]] broke in to the [[Hall of Reason]] to find (together with [[Narissa]]) and probably why he was murdered - to cover it up.
			- This is the murder Narissa was then blamed for by The Clasp.
		- We also tried to find these documents later on (*see [[Session 40]]*) but they were gone.
	- We also found evidence of something marked as "additional shop loan payments" in Tristan's ledger of transactions. When asked about this, Tristan confirmed that he gets money that he then sends "upstairs" to The Clasp. Presumably monthly payments coming from The League.
	- **This confirms a clear connection between The League and The Clasp!**
- So other than securing hard evidence, the final question is the motivation, the *why*. Why are The League colluding with The Clasp?
	- One theory that connects all of this is that The Clasp are the ones that procure the different magical beasts *for* The League, and that's what The League are paying them for.
	- The League then uses these beasts to intimidate The Council and get them to agree to the costly protection contract.
- But one thing I still don't get is why did someone from The League co-sign the deed for the store with Tristan? That would leave a paper trail, which seems like a big risk. Couldn't they just have given him money to pay for it himself, without leaving any evidence?
---
[[Session 47]]
- *The Why / Motivation*
	- The League are colluding with The Clasp to create enough danger for the [[Council of Westruun]] to agree to the contract
	- This would be mutually beneficial for both parties:
		- The League gets payment from Westruun and more power
		- The Clasp gets to do whatever they want once The League has taken over defense of the city
- [[Honor Kinnabari]] tells us that it's not uncommon for The League to back deals like the one to buy the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]], so leaving that paper trail wouldn't necessarily be strange
- Honor can get us into [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]] and we should do it right away because [[Dragomir Lunthak]] and [[Ashcombe Paltimore]] are both out for the day
- We get into Lunthak's office and find the deed to the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]], signed by Lunthak. The smoking gun!! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
- Narissa also finds a book called "*The Craftsmanship of an Agreement*" by [[Donaldus Trumpus]] in one of the book shelves. Can this be used to decipher the letter we found?
- We are teleported to a secret underground laboratory through an enchanted painting in Lunthak's office and fight off three flesh golems
- We also find a leather-bound journal with entries inside that detail shipments. It mentions [[Aeor]]ian artifacts
	- "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the Planar Scythe. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the ShadowÂ ThatÂ Was.*"

[[Session 48]]
- Narissa tries to use "*The Craftsmanship of an Agreement*" book to decipher the note from the dumbwaiter - INT check (21)
	- "*Nice trick with the dragon. I'll ask my people to make their killings a tad bit more public than usual. That should more than guarantee the contract you're looking for. I trust you will keep up your side of the bargain regarding our cut of that money.*" - [[Gholesh]]
		- Who is Gholesh?
- We feel ready to go back to [[Billiam Christ]] and tell him all we've found regarding the collusion between [[The League of Miracles]] & [[The Clasp]]:
	- **Motive**
		- The League are colluding with The Clasp to create enough danger for the [[Council of Westruun]] to agree to an expensive contract where The League would offer additional protection of Westruun
		- This would be mutually beneficial for both parties:
			- The League gets payment from Westruun and more power
			- The Clasp gets to do whatever they want once The League has taken over defense of the city
	- **Hard evidence**
		- The deed for the Leatherworking store that's been signed by Dragomir Lunthak
		- The deciphered note from the dumbwaiter, written by [[Gholesh]]
	- **Circumstantial evidence**
		- The story from [[Tristan Stonesworn]] about what goes on at the store
		- The dumbwaiter leading to [[The Clasp]] hideout, "Upstairs" from the store (connecting the store to The Clasp)
		- Information from the ledger we found, i.e. "Additional shop loan payments"
		- Other information about The Dragon attack, The [[Nullifier]], and The Magma Landshark attacks
			- We also found additional evidence about the involvement of the League regarding the Dragon attack in [[Ashcombe Paltimore]]'s office
