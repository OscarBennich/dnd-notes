- [[The League of Miracles]]
- [[The Clasp]]
- From [[Billiam Christ]] in [[Westruun]]
	- The quest is *actually* from [[Lysandra Kalloss]] (indirectly)
	- Because she suspects that there are people on the [[Council of Westruun]] involved and she doesn't want them to know
---
- Debt is being used as leverage against the council
- If The League has ties to the Clasp it would make them outright illegal
- This would be evidence that the league is a criminal organization
- Billiam wants this for the good of [[Westruun]] (is that true?)
- We need to be discrete
- 2 paths:
	- (1) Go through the Clasp tavern in the Market Ward (HQ? Cover?)
		- [[The Saddled Plainscow]]
	- (2) Go through the league
		- There's going to be a [[Big Ball]] in a week or two
		- Billiam can get us in
		- At the [[Lysandra Kalloss]]'s house
		- [[Gilmore]] might be at the ball
		- We need to get expensive clothes so we can blend in
		- [[Simon Cloudfang]] might be at the ball too
		- Could [[Buddleah Austan]] be there as well?

[[Session 34]]
- Prominent members of [[The League of Miracles]] will be at the [[Big Ball]]

[[Session 42]]
- [[Mads]], [[Narissa]], and [[Dain]] go speak to [[Buddleah Austan]]
- She has some *suspicions* regarding the woman in the woods and [[Dragomir Lunthak]]
- She doesn't want to discuss it during the party but we're welcome to come by [[House Austan]] and speak to her
- Next steps:
	- [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]] 🆕
	- Go to the offices of [[The League of Miracles]] in [[Westruun]] and see what we can find there
	- Go back to the grave of the [[Investigate Bramblewood woman wandering outside of town|woman in the woods]] and use *Speak with Dead* to figure out more info about Lunthak
		- Her body has probably been taken by [[The Shields]] though...

[[Session 43]]
- We found out that the tracks leading from the summoning of the dragon that attacked the [[Big Ball]] lead directly to the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]

[[Session 44]]
- [[Buddleah Austan]] told us she believed [[Dragomir Lunthak]] killed his servant [[Janet]] (even though she doesn't have proof) because Janet found something she shouldn't have and he tried to cover it up
- She also showed us a letter from [[Lila Lunthak]] to [[Hugh Austan]] in which she says she chose to leave Dragomir because he prioritized his "disgusting experiments" and that he is to blame for their daughters "fate"
	- Meaning he is to blame for [[Mads]] becoming a Tiefling?
- Were these experiments what [[Janet]] stumbled across?
- (see [[Go to House Austan and speak to Buddleah]])
- If Dragomir has hidden any evidence of these experiments in his office, we could use them to expose him and that might lead us to a connection between The League and The Clasp.

[[Session 45]]
- Different ways to infiltrate the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]
	- Speak to [[Honor Kinnabari]]
	- Utilize the fact that [[Mads]] is [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s daughter
	- Go into the offices during the day and then break in during the night
		- Utilize *Seeming* in some way?

[[Session 46]]
- See [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]]
	- [[Tristan Stonesworn]] told us that he was asked to purchase the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] from a letter that apparently came from [[The League of Miracles]]
- We should talk to [[Honor Kinnabari]] about what we found out about the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] and the connection to The League as well as the connection to the dragon attack (see [[Investigate the Dragon attack at the Big Ball]])
	- We think Honor would be interested in uncovering the truth, even if she works for The League
- We now *know* there is a connection between The Clasp and The League but we need some hard evidence to give to [[Billiam Christ]]
- The best thing would be if we could find the deed that was stolen from the [[Hall of Reason]], then that would have the signature of the guarantor from [[The League of Miracles]] which would prove the connection
---
**What do we know so far?**
- [[The League of Miracles]] has made a lot of money helping rebuild [[Westruun]] after the [[Chroma Crisis]].
	- Westruun still owes a considerable amount of money to The League for this. This debt is being used as leverage against the council.
- They have made an offer to the [[Council of Westruun]] to give Westruun additional protection (*see [[Session 43]]*). Apparently it is very expensive and the council has been reluctant to accept this offer.
	- This gives The League a clear incentive to intimidate Westruun and the Council into accepting this contact.
	- This is what they tried to do with the Dragon attack at the [[Big Ball]] (we know this was The League's doing because the magical traces lead back to [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]]).
	- We also know that The League was involved in some way with the [[Nullifier]] in the [[Chianfanelli Bank]] as we found a note that said:
  
	  *"To be delivered to Cianfanelli Bank in Westruun and await collection by [[Dragomir Lunthak]]"*
  
	  (see [[Session 31]])
	- The Cianfanelli Bank also manages the debt that Westruun owes the League.
	- We also know there was an attack by Magma Landsharks in the Market Ward (*see [[Session 41]]*) but we don't have any evidence that The League where behind that (yet).
	- And the Night Hag (Luella the Dawnstealer) also mentioned knowing [[Mads]]' father ([[Dragomir Lunthak]]). What could that mean?
- After investigating the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] (*see [[Session 46]] / [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]]*) and interrogating [[Tristan Stonesworn]], he confirmed multiple things:
	- [[The Clasp]] are behind the murder of [[Feena]] and did this because she refused to sell the shop to them.
	- Tristan was told through a letter to purchase the store after Feena was murdered. He didn't have the money so he had a guarantor who co-signed the deed. This person was from The League.
		- This is the deed that [[Steppen Wolfe]] broke in to the [[Hall of Reason]] to find (together with [[Narissa]]) and probably why he was murdered - to cover it up.
			- This is the murder Narissa was then blamed for by The Clasp.
		- We also tried to find these documents later on (*see [[Session 40]]*) but they were gone.
	- We also found evidence of something marked as "additional shop loan payments" in Tristan's ledger of transactions. When asked about this, Tristan confirmed that he gets money that he then sends "upstairs" to The Clasp. Presumably monthly payments coming from The League.
	- **This confirms a clear connection between The League and The Clasp!**
- So other than securing hard evidence, the final question is the motivation, the *why*. Why are The League colluding with The Clasp?
	- One theory that connects all of this is that The Clasp are the ones that procure the different magical beasts *for* The League, and that's what The League are paying them for.
	- The League then uses these beasts to intimidate The Council and get them to agree to the costly protection contract.
- But one thing I still don't get is why did someone from The League co-sign the deed for the store with Tristan? That would leave a paper trail, which seems like a big risk. Couldn't they just have given him money to pay for it himself, without leaving any evidence?
---
[[Session 47]]
- We start heading to [[Bäkerz Bakery]]
- [[Honor Kinnabari]] is standing outside the bakery
- [[Ansel Bäker]]'s mother is manning the counter - [[Linda Bäker]]
- We grab something to eat and head to a park to be able to speak more privately
- I insist on paying even though Linda wanted to give it to us for free (Persuasion check = 28)
- We start explaining the situation to [[Honor Kinnabari]]
- Persuasion check from Narissa = 16
- Honor: Dragomir takes all kinds of strange shipments for the League
- Honor wanted to be able to give out spells for free but someone in [[The League of Miracles]] insisted on taking money for it
- Skyport contract?
- Honor: Lots of people are in the league for their own reasons, [[Dragomir Lunthak]] seems to be in it to gain access to things he otherwise wouldn't have
- Dragomir's assistant: [[Ashcombe Paltimore]] 
- People usually contact Dragomir for high-price contracts - we wouldn't really be able to get into contact with him without rousing suspicion
- The Magma Landshark attacks where a few months ago
	- So this could also have been staged like the other attacks...
- Increased attacks and crime rates in and around the city
	- The Clasp is probably behind this (together with The League)
- *The Why / Motivation*
	- The League are colluding with The Clasp to create enough danger for the [[Council of Westruun]] to agree to the contract
	- This would be mutually beneficial for both parties:
		- The League gets payment from Westruun and more power
		- The Clasp gets to do whatever they want once The League has taken over defense of the city
- It's not uncommon for The League to back deals like the one to buy the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]], so leaving that paper trail wouldn't necessarily be strange
- Honor can get us into [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]] and we should do it right away because [[Dragomir Lunthak]] and [[Ashcombe Paltimore]] are both out for the day
- I cast *Seeming* and we all look like the characters from the D&D Movie
- We take a short rest (let me reset my spell slots) and start heading to the offices
- We enter the offices and are greeted by [[Cecilia Brightwater]]
	- [[Honor Kinnabari]] hates her
- She asks for our names
	- Jarnathan
	- Chris Pine
	- Holga Kilgore
	- Doric
	- Xenk Yendar
	- Bradley Cooper
- We call our party "Deeanddeemoviegang" (D&D Movie Gang)
- [[Chip]] asks Cecilia about the interior of the building and fills out a complaint form
- Honor leads us down a corridor
- Along it are paintings detailing the destruction and reconstruction of Westruun
- We reach the end of the corridor
- The door on the left is [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s, the one on the right is [[Ashcombe Paltimore]]'s
	- They're supposed to be gone for the rest of the afternoon (3 hours)
- Mads casts *Pass without Trace*
- [[Dain]] casts *Major Image* to make the corridor look empty (think Road Runner, Looney Tunes) while we wait for 10min for me to cast *Detect Magic* as a ritual
- Someone walks past but doesn't notice us
- After casting *Detect Magic* I don't sense magic on either of the doors, nor any magic behind them - lead doors?
- [[Narissa]] picks the door to Dragomir's office
	- As she turns the knob, spores explode in our face
	- We all need to make a CON saving throw
		- Chip and Narissa are *poisoned* for the next hour
- Chip: *"Ouchie, ouchie, ow, ow. I don't feel so good...*
- We open the door and see a large sturdy desk in the middle of the room, a crystal chandelier in the ceiling. Shelves line the room.
- We enter the office and start investigating
- We find a letter from [[Bognor Regis]] that is complaining about the destruction wrought by the *creature from Aeor* (the [[Nullifier]] from the bank)
	- Aeor: see [[A History of Tal’Dorei]]
- We also find a letter from [[Walter Leyton-Beasly]] informing [[Dragomir Lunthak]] about delays to the [[Residuum]] shipments
- Narissa finds a latch in one of the drawers
	- We find the deed to the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]!
	- It's signed by Dragomir Lunthak
	- The smoking gun!! 🔥🔥
	- We put it in our [[Bag of Holding]]
- Narissa also finds a book called "*The Craftsmanship of an Agreement*" by [[Donaldus Trumpus]] in one of the book shelves
	- It's slightly tilted
	- Can this be used to decipher the letter we found?
	- We also take it and put it in our [[Bag of Holding]]
- Chip comes up with the idea to shift *all* books so Dragomir doesn't know what we stole
- There's a painting on the that depicts a halfling that is sitting on an alcove, reading a book called "*The Escapades of Hilora Bramblesong*"
	- She's called [[Hilora Bramblesong]] (history check) - known for her riddles
	- It is magic - *conjuration*
	- Is it like the living mirror in Snow White?
	- [[Dain]] makes a perception check - 21
	- Looking closer - we see one of the pages of the book she's reading, on it we see: "The beginning of eternity, the end of time and place. Either side of every eve, the edge of every face."
	- It looks like the painting is following us with her eyes
	- Dain does a INT check - Nat 20!
		- The wording of the riddle is very specific, we need to pay attention to the words.
	- Beginning of eternity ➡️ e
	- End of time and place ➡️ e
	- Either side of every eve ➡️ e
	- The edge of every face ➡️ e
- Dain touches the "E" in the title of the book, he vanishes!
	- We all end up touching the "E". We all vanish...
- Dain arrives at the top of a staircase, behind him is a stone wall, a staircase leading down. Sconces burning with blue and green light.
- Chip appears. Then Mads. Then Ossian. Then Narissa and I.
- We follow the staircase.
	- A large room. Workbenches. Loads of bookshelves with materials and reagents. 
	- No windows. 
	- Is this where [[Dragomir Lunthak]] does his experiments?
	- We notice a *hum* of arcane energy and the stench of decay
	- On a large stone table in the center of the room are 3 massive humanoid figures...
	- A heavy necrotic presence is coming from them
- Chip feels sick - something isn't right here
- Narissa hears angry, discordant whispers
- I hear my patron, she disapproves
- Chip looks at some of the books, they seem to be books on a few of the things we've encountered:
	- Undead, Demons, Raven Queen, Druids, Rituals
	- And a discarded book on [[The Whispered One]] (*hint hint* 😉) 
- One of the creatures on the table have a contraption over it's head which lightning crackling
- Narissa and Ossian are looking around
	- Empty crates with the [[The League of Miracles]] symbol on them
	- An eyeball encased in a gem
	- A glass jar of black pearls
	- Various spell components
	- A silver ritual knife that radiates a faint necrotic energy
	- As Ossian reaches for the eyeball - him and Narissa need to make a CON save
		- Ossian saves but Narissa is now poisoned for 2 hours and takes 34 points of damage
- Chip walks on a pressure plate and as he does the lightning in the machine crackles even more and a *Lightning Bolt* is cast on him
	- DEX save, 20, saved!
	- With *Evasion*, Chip takes no damage
- As that happens, the three creatures wake up..
	- Combat! *See [[Session 47]]*
- The flesh golems lie wasted on the floor... They are no longer a threat to us and we are free to investigate
- Narissa finds a note on the bench in the middle with information about the constructs
	- "*Use for protection force?*"
- Chip notices that one of the main work benches looks like where Dragomir keeps all his notes - he finds another button like the one in Dragomir's office
	- He presses it
- It contains a small vial with some red liquid that looks like blood
- He also finds a leatherbound journal
	- There are entries that detail shipments
	- Mentions of Aeorian artifacts
- We also find a locket with a picture inside
	- An inscription - "To eternity, as one" and the initials *M.L.* (Mads' mother?)
	- Mads makes a WIS check - 12... 
	- She doesn't remember her mother or know if the picture if of her or not
- We also find a book called "The Codex of the Unspoken", it lies open
	- It seems to be about drawing energy from the Abyss to create constructs
