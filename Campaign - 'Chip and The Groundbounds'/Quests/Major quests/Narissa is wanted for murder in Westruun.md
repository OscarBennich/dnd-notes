- We bar the door, break the window and escape
- We also manage to steal another document from the record room to make it seem like we weren't there for the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]

- Chip makes a perception check (29) - he sees through a small gap in the curtain on the second floor, a flicker of light and a shadow passing by
- I sense magic on the first floor, where I saw the magic when we were inside the building during the day and one more spot (Tristan's medallion probably). But none for the door to the second story

- I see some papers on the work bench, *Investigation* check, they turn out to be nothing, but I also see a locked drawer
- Narissa picks the lock
- She finds a "Ledger of Transactions" in the drawer
- There is one item in the ledger that occurs regularly, ~ once per month, called "Additional shop loan payments", on top of his normal loan payments
- If Tristan was paying this type of money, he should have less money total, it doesn't add up. But the money he gets is also paid out again...
	- *Money laundering*?
- We go into the living quarters behind the work bench
- It is a room in front of Tristan's bedroom
- We smell a dank smell of earth and decay. *A basement?*
- The magical signature is pointing to a painting on the wall
	- The picture is of [[Feena]]
- There is also a very feint magical signature is also coming from a half-dead plant in the corner
	- Some kind of residue of magic - difficult to place
	- It's leaves have turned an unnatural black
- Chip makes a WIS saving throw - his hand is drawn forward to the plant, he pricks his finger and blood is drawn
- Everyone in the room hears the same vision:
	- "I told you girl, you should have sold."
	- "Do it! [[The Spireling]] says no loose ends."
	- "As you wish."
	- The slash of steel, a cry of pain - [[Feena]]'s
- An aural vision of Feena's murder it seems, somehow triggered by touching the thorny plant in the room
