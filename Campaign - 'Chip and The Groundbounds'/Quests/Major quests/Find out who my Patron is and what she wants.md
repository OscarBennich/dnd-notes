[[Session 17]]
* I ask her what she wants and she responds "*Entertainment, loyalty, a bit of fun*"

[[Session 23]]
- I dream of my [[Patron]] in the Feywild
- She had lost her connection to me while the Hag was in control, but now she is back
- She is upset that she lost her connection

[[Session 32]]
- We decide to head to the [[Cobalt Reserve]] to do research
- I look for information about my Patron
- Similar to the Night Hag?
- [[The Spider Queen]] - God of Deceit
- Devils / demons make pacts
- Old eldritch beings
- Fey, Archfey
- "Expositor" - "Beauregard Linett" left a note about Archfey
	- [[Lord Artagan of the Morncrown]]
	- [[Lord Saundor the Forsaken]]

[[Session 33]]
- [[Potentate Sammanar]]

[[Session 36]]
- I talk to my patron
- She is upset that I'm not following her commands so she took my magic away (temporarily)
- She will give me her names in exchange for being able to make decisions for me
	- I get 3 names
- My patron is called "Desdemona"?
- It is one of many names...
- [[Desdemona]] was an employee at the [[The Ironhand Trading Company]]
- She was also disguised as [[Portia]] from [[Stilben]] and [[Juliette]] from [[Drynna]]!
- She likes to flip between planes
- Next steps:
	- Go back to [[Cobalt Reserve]] and keep researching

[[Session 43]]
- "I have a touch of the **Fey**. This isn't Fey."
	- See: [[Investigate the Dragon attack at the Big Ball]]

[[Session 44]]
- I go to the [[Cobalt Reserve]] and read more about Archfey
- Roll DC6 = 5 + 3
- I find out about 2 more [[Archfey]]:
	- [[Lady Elmenore the Unforgiving]]
	- [[Queen Titania of the Summer Court]]
- The description of Queen Titania sounds a lot like my Patron...

[[Session 45]]
- "So how do you pronounce it, *Titania* or *Titania*?"
- "Why must you always rush? Relax a little. Good things come to those who wait"
- Will I be able to see your real form?
- "If you're lucky"
- "I have a use for you, I will tell you when we meet" (during the week)
- She has one more Archfey decision left
- "Cause chaos, charm a few people, be a little bit more in my image"
- If I do this, she'll give me a reward ðŸ¤‘
- "I'll show you chaos ðŸ˜ˆ" I say in my head
	- I look for some people from [[Friends of the Minack]] in the Underwalk
	- Investigation check, Nat 20!
	- I find one of them sitting in [[Bessie's Best]]
	- I disguise myself as a guard from [[The Shields]] using *Disguise Self*
	- Deception check, Nat 20!
	- [[Bess]] talks to me
	- I try to bribe her by flipping a platinum coin in her direction, but it ends up on the floor
	- Me and the Minack guy head out of the bar
	- "Karl Waters" - 52 years old
	- Turns out the [[Friends of the Minack]] don't have a HQ
	- My plan was for him to take me to their HQ, then cast *Seeming* on all of them to create some chaos, but without causing any actual harm
	- But that plan is now ruined...
	- I panic and just end up casting *Sleep* on him
	- I then transform to "Pile Duncan" again (that I did [[Session 40|before]]) so I don't draw attention to myself as a Shield guard
	- Another person sees him sleeping in the alley and asks me if he had too much to drink, I answer "Yes" and clear the Deception check (12)
	- I then run away from the Underwalk

[[Session 48]]
- I talk to my [[Patron]] after seeing my room at [[Caliban House]]
	- "I guess you're rubbing off on me" (there's lots of Fey-inspired details)
- I ask her when I get to see her - "Patience" she says
- During that night, I am visited by [[Queen Titania of the Summer Court]] in a vision
- From the garden of [[Caliban House]] she leads me to her Summer Court where she conjures a throne made of vines, looking almost like a sleeping dragon
- There's a silver pool of water in front of me with a stepped waterfall
- In the center of the pool and directly in front of the pool is a larger lily pad
- I successfully jump across and soon stand before her - "You wanted to meet me, here I am..."
- Titania has taken many forms during our adventure:
	- [[Portia]] from [[Stilben]]
	- [[Juliette]] from [[Drynna]]
	- Miranda from [[Turst Fields]]
	- [[Desdemona]] from [[Westruun]]
	- [[Madame Maab]] from [[Westruun]]
	- Rosalind from [[Westhall Academy]] in [[Westruun]]
- She tells me what she wants from me is to stop [[Dragomir Lunthak]] from releasing [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]], or kill Orcus, or both. I'm not quite sure.
- The reason is because one of the [[Druids of the Dawn Circle]] that Orcus killed in [[Shadebarrow]] "belonged" to her
- So I know now *who* my patron is âž¡ [[Queen Titania of the Summer Court]]
- And I know *what she wants* âž¡ Stop [[Dragomir Lunthak]] from releasing [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]
