## Background
There has been undead activity reported on the plains between [[Drynna]] and [[Westruun]] ([[Session 14]], [[Session 15]], [[Session 36]]).

When meeting [[Meg Ruddlestone]] in [[Westruun]], she told us that as she was travelling from [[Drynna]], in the forest somewhere, Undead things came towards her, and then seemingly shed died ([[Session 36]]). She says there was "undead stuff" happening on the plains and she knows she was east of [[Gatshadow]] and south of the road. It seems she was somehow turned undead in [[Shadebarrow]]. But at the same time retaining her sanity for some unknown reason.

When I asked [[Mother Veyra]] about Meg, she said that if someone was turned undead but kept their "soul", the [[Matron of Ravens]] might have a reason for it.

[[Buddleah Austan]] (descendent of [[Sevil Howthess]]) told us in [[Session 44]] that she has sent "quite a few" treasure seeking adventurers to their death / undeath in search of Shadebarrow. Apparently [[Camilla Tenver]] (her cousin) gave up the location of the tomb to someone who then came back as an undead and killed their whole family. This was 15-20 years ago and after that they wanted to keep the location of Shadebarrow secret "forever".

From [[A History of Tal’Dorei]], we learned that [[Shadebarrow]] used to be a sanctuary for sun-worshiping Druids ([[Druids of the Dawn Circle]]) before [[Trist Drassig]] slew everyone there in a rage. [[Neminar Drassig]], brother of [[Trist Drassig]], was an infamous necromancer and had made a pact with [[Bane the Strife Emperor]] to bless his troops. Trist then used the same connection to Bane to make a pact with [[Graz’zt the Demon Prince of Pleasure]] and had a legion of demons to join his forces. Despite this, he was defaeated in the [[A History of Tal’Dorei#Chapter 10 The Battle of the Umbra Hills|The Battle of the Umbra Hills]], ending the Drassig bloodline, and with it the demonic pact that the Drassigs had made. This demonic pact also drew the attention of another demon prince: [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]].

[[Queen Titania of the Summer Court]] (my Patron) later told us that after this battle, a Druid that "belonged" to her participated in a druidic ritual performed in Shadebarrow which succeeded in imprisoning Orcus, capturing him in a pocket dimension instead of his home plane, [[The Abyss]] ([[Session 48]]).

> *At this point we do not know who these druids were exactly but they could be remnants of the [[Druids of the Dawn Circle]] that went back to Shadebarrow. Imprisoning Orcus might also be a kind of revenge for the slaughter of their Druid allies...*

Eventually, [[Sevil Howthess]], baron of Westruun, purchased Shadebarrow from the unions at great cost. Being obsessed with its history, he became interred there upon his death. The tomb is supposedly outfitted with protections, and with the remnants of his fortune.

While investigating and confronting [[Dragomir Lunthak]] in [[Westruun]] we learn that he was told about Shadebarrow by [[Luella the Dawnstealer]] and that she convinced him that it was a source of immense power that had been locked away ([[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath|Orcus]]). Using this power he would be able to protect those he loved and be granted eternal life. In exchange for this information (and potentially other parts of this bargain), [[Mads]], his daughter, was born as a Tiefling ([[Session 47]], [[Session 48]], [[Session 49]], [[Session 50]]).

The way he intends to free Orcus from the pocket dimension he is currently imprisoned in is by using something called the [[Planar Scythe]] as we found a note ([[Session 47]]) in his laboratory that stated:

>"*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the [[Planar Scythe]]. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the Shadow That Was.*"

In the same lab we also found a lot of books on the topics of Necromancy, Druids, and [[The Abyss]] ([[Session 48]]).

As Dragomir is trying to free Orcus, the undead presence in the area around Shadebarrow is increasing.

**Visions and "The Storm"**
[[Chip]] was sent to [[Tal'Dorei]] by [[Eebah]] to find this magical storm that supposedly is related to a threat to the world - based on his visions. We spoke to [[Simon Cloudfang]] in [[Westruun]] about this and he said that that the magical "storm" could be a metaphor for something that corrupts nature. And that **could** refer to something like hoards of undead. So it is safe to say that the *storm* and the threat against the world is actually Shadebarrow and the potential release of Orcus.

 [[Narissa]] also had visions when visiting the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens|Twilit temple]] in Westruun that included an undead army.

## Location
- [[Buddleah Austan]] decided to tell us how to find Shadebarrow. She told us that mists surround the place and that we need to be able to navigate dense forests.
- It is east of [[Westruun]] and south of the road from [[Westruun]] to [[Turst Fields]] but there's not a lot of visible markers.
- We need to travel down the *Silvercut Roadway* south for 5 days, and then east for 5 days.
- We know we will have found it when we found the standing stones (henge stones).
- Shadebarrow is also roughly marked on an early map we found.

## Extra info
- In [[Session 49]], [[Queen Titania of the Summer Court|Titania]] told us that Orcus is vulnerable to *Radiant damage* and *Holy Water*

## Objectives
- We need to stop [[Dragomir Lunthak]] from using the [[Planar Scythe]] to release [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] from the pocket dimension he is currently imprisoned in
	- In exchange for this, Dragomir has been promised "powers to protect those he loves" and eternal life
	- *If* Dragomir were to succeed, we need to figure out a way to kill and/or stop Orcus instead but he can only be killed on his own plane ([[The Abyss]])
- We also need to watch out for any potential protections guarding the tomb of [[Sevil Howthess]]
