### Background
- There has been undead activity reported on the plains between [[Drynna]] & [[Westruun]] (see [[Session 14]], [[Session 15]], [[Session 36]]).
- We know that [[Shadebarrow]] used to be a sanctuary for sun-worshiping Druids before [[Trist Drassig]] slew everyone there in a rage (see [[A History of Talâ€™Dorei]]).
- While visiting the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]] and talking to [[Mother Veyra]], she told us that a slaughter like this will leave a mark - it could attract undead to it, or other magical forces.
- We also know from [[Simon Cloudfang]] that the magical "storm" that [[Chip]] has been hunting for could be a metaphor for something that corrupts nature. And that **could** refer to something like hoards of undead.
- This undead horde seems to be connected to Shadebarrow.
- We also know that [[Narissa]] previously had visions when visiting the Twilit temple that included an undead army.
- Later on, [[Sevil Howthess]], baron of Westruun, purchased Shadebarrow from the unions at great cost. Being obsessed with its history, he became interred there upon his death. The tomb is supposedly outfitted with protections, and with the remnants of his fortune.
- [[Buddleah Austan]] (descendent of [[Sevil Howthess]]) told us in [[Session 44]] that she has sent "quite a few" treasure seeking adventurers to their death / undeath and that [[Camilla Tenver]] (her cousin) gave up the location of the tomb to someone who then came back as an undead and killed their whole family. This was 15-20 years ago and after that they wanted to keep the location of Shadebarrow secret "forever".
	- Whatever happened to this person seems to be something similar to what happened to [[Meg Ruddlestone]] as she told us in [[Session 36]] (see [[Find the magical storm]]) that she was travelling from [[Drynna]] to [[Westruun]], in the forest somewhere. Undead things came towards her, and then seemingly shed died.
	- She says there was "undead stuff" happening on the plains and she knows she was east of [[Gatshadow]] and south of the road.
	- She was seemingly turned undead in Shadebarrow. But she seems to have retained her sanity for some unknown reason.
	- When I asked [[Mother Veyra]] about Meg, she said that if someone was turned undead but kept their "soul", the [[Matron of Ravens]] might have a reason for it.
- Buddleah then decided to tell us how to find Shadebarrow. She told us that mists surround the place and that we need to be able to navigate dense forests.
- It is east of [[Westruun]] and south of the road from [[Westruun]] to [[Turst Fields]] but there's not a lot of visible markers.
- We need to travel down the *Silvercut Roadway* south for 5 days, and then east for 5 days.
- We know we will have found it when we found the standing stones (henge stones).
- Shadebarrow is also roughly marked on an early map we found.

- What or _who_ is creating this undead force in Shadebarrow? We need to stop it.
- We need to watch out for any potential protections guarding the tomb of [[Sevil Howthess]].
