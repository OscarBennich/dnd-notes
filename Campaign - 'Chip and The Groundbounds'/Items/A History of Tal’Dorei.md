# Part 1: The Myth of Exandria
To understand the history of [[Tal'Dorei]], one must first begin to discuss the history of [[Exandria]] itself. Exandria, the world, is home to four major continents: Issylra, [[Wildemount]], [[Marquet]] and Tal’Dorei. These hold dozens of nations, untold tiny pockets of civilization and a wondrous, dangerous wildness. Each civilization has its own interpretation of where its story began, with an enormous number of associated creation myths. 

However, the collected minds of the Cobalt Soul and Emon’s Alabaster Lyceum both agree upon the fact that the city of Vasselheim in Issylra deserves its title of “Dawn City”. To the best of our knowledge, this is where civilization as we currently know it began. It houses the earliest known records of history and the earliest known temples to the gods. One of these documents is the earliest account of the Founding. The following is a brief summary of this text.

## Chapter 1: The Founding
Long ago the world was a tumultuous landscape of elemental forces, naught but unbridled fire, seething oceans, gnashing rock and churning wind. To this Primordial Creation, the gods arrived from an unknown realm located beyond the ether. They looked upon this land and saw opportunity and purpose.

Correlon the Arch Heart created the First Children, the elves. They walked upon the land and gazed upon the beauty of the lush Green and Heavenly blue as the gods tamed the Primordial Creation around them.

Moradin the All-Hammer then created the dwarves - a hearty people imbued with the desire to continue the gods’ work of taming the world with craft and invention.

Erathis the Lawbearer and Melora the Wildmother, as the passionate lovers of Order and Chaos, then gave birth to a third people, the humans. The beings were endowed with hearts of passion to bring meaning to an increasingly orderly world. In their hearts there was a spark of chaos, cursing them with short lives but with unquenchable ambitions, mirth and curiosity.

As inspiration flowed from these early forms of the gods, many other creations, including additional species, followed. However, it is said that sorrow filled the hearts of the gods as they watched their children struggle against the vicious and wild land around them. Therefore, the gods bestowed upon them a bit of their own power to shape the world around them. This power was, however, directly linked to the gods themselves and could not be shaped without their approval.

## Chapter 2: The Wrath of the Primordials
Beneath the unruly elements, and supposedly unknown to the Creators, lived ancient beings who were born in the primeval chaos of the world that they had found. These were the Primordials, elemental titans that once dealt deep within the land who rose up to destroy all those that had been created to walk upon it. 

Some gods, filled with grief and anger as they saw their children crushed, wished to abandon the world for another. They wished to join the Primordials in reclaiming the realm for chaos, so that they could move on and start anew. This led to a schism between the gods, with the faction inclined towards chaos later being dubbed the “Betrayer Gods”.

The cosmos itself seemed to sense the magnitude of the battle on Exandria, and chaotic creatures emerged from a formless void that Exandrians later called the Abyss to feed upon the suffering of the wounded and dying. These are the demons.

Other beings known as celestials, sentinels of order, aided the Prime Deities in continuing to try and tame the primordial world to save their children, and protect them from the Primordial Titans and the Betrayers.

The Betrayers then forced order upon some of the demons turning them into devils, perfectly lawful soldiers who lived only to cause harm.

As the clash between gods and Primordials spiraled out of control, the desperate mortal races sought their own way to defend themselves from these vast and overwhelming powers. Correlon the Arch Heart in an act of subterfuge and/or benevolence (depending on who you ask) taught them the secrets of making magic themselves, without the aid of divine power. With these new potent magics, these resourceful mortals subdued the Primordials long enough for the Prime Deities to banish their traitorous kin to secluded prison planes, locking the Betrayers away. The defeated Primordials were destroyed and their essences channeled to the Elemental Planes that surround the material world of [[Exandria]]. 

What followed was the first idyllic peace since the Creation, which in turn allowed for the first enduring mortal civilization to be established, headquartered so to speak in Vasselheim, and the world was named [[Exandria]].

## Chapter 3: The Age of Arcanum
Ages past, society flourished, great kingdoms sprung up and castles were built in a day - all facilitated by the mortal arcanists’ newfound power. Whole cities rose from the ground and soared the skies across the magical ley lines of the world. One such city is Aeor, the ruins of which can now be found scattered across Eiselcross, a frigid wasteland to the north of Wildemount.

Yet, perhaps with the benefit of hindsight, the very magic which allowed mortalkind to prosper also instilled a deep rot within their civilizations. The arcanists grew arrogant. They came to see their arcane gifts as proof that neither the gods, nor nature itself, held any sway over their fate, and with a sophisticated enough command of magic they could become as powerful as the gods themselves.

The more religiously devout accounts of history state this rebelliousness saddened the Prime Deities, who after all had imprisoned their own kin to protect their children, but they sought to sympathise with their creations, hoping that the mortals would learn the error of their ways.

The abundance that began the Age of Arcanum did not last, as it gave way to endless petty squabbles over wealth and power among the elite, while those without magic hunted for scraps. 

Tantalising rumours of immortality began to slither through the most decadent circles of arcanists, magi and nobility. One mortal mage, her name lost and struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites, challenging, and subsequently felling the God of Death. She took his place among the pantheon, making her the first and only living mortal to ascend to divinity. Only the title of this successor, or to some, usurper, survives - The Matron of Ravens.

Her ascension became a catalyst for many of the horrors of the Age of Arcanum, as other arcanists sought to imitate her. An archmage named Vespin Chloras, renowned throughout ancient Vasselheim for his wealth, skill and cruelty, sought the guidance and power of the banished Betrayer gods so that he could do the same. What happened instead was that he wrought asunder the gates of their prisons, releasing the Betrayers and allowing them to walk Exandria once more, next to the Prime Deities.

The gods of hatred and despair had warped their prisons into reflections of their depravity. The Abyss, once a formless place of chaos and a by-product of the gods’ creation, was twisted into a place of evil, and the Hells were created and presided upon by Asmodeus the Lord of the Hells.

  

The released Betrayers created a new kingdom on the far end of the world, the capital of which was named Ghor Dranas, the Gathering of Shadows. Here, the twisted power of their corrupted planes seeped into the world, scaring the lands and drawing to them the mortals susceptible to the gods’ grand promises of infinite power over the arcane. Eventually, the Betrayers led an assault on Vasselheim itself.

  

Other volumes have detailed what we know about the battle, but in short, the Betrayers came close and reduced much of Vasselheim to rubble, but were defeated by a combined force of metallic dragons and Prime Deities. This victory did not however lead to peace. Instead it was the beginning of the Calamity. 

# Part 2: The Calamity and the Divergence
Following the evils exposed by the attack on Vasselheim by the Betrayers forces, the mortal peoples were engulfed by fear. Elves used their understanding of creation’s beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force. Dwarves became isolationists, burrowing into the depths of the earth and using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. Fearing all powers but their own, the most egotistical and talented human arcanists warped their magical creations of prosperity and joy into arms and armour of horrific power. For the first time, the focus of magic was warfare.

## Chapter 4: The Calamity
Few records remain of the terrible war that followed when mortals and gods walked the earth, battling each other’s forces of destruction. Most tales are found in the temples of Vasselheim, and depict great champions that the Prime Deities blessed with their power. One tale even tells of a champion blessed by three of the gods in their time of greatest needs. Some deities went so far as to create warrior beings from light and holy fire. Others chose to imbue their power into weapons now called the Vestiges of Divergence.

Again, other volumes cover this topic extensively, however the main takeaway relevant to the tale of Tal’Dorei is that this period of war, which lasted a few hundred years, caused unfathomable destruction across all of Exandria, erasing almost all traces of the ancient civilizations we now know so little about. So great was the loss of life during the war that even liberal estimates put the number of survivors at no more than a third of Exandria’s population. This devastation led to some peoples and civilizations even fleeing to other planes, scattering the Children of Creation across the multiverse. 

## Chapter 5: The Divergence

The victorious Prime Deities banished their kin once more to their realms of deception and hate and the world entered into a long and dark period of recovery. Recognising the role of the unrestrained clash between divine beings in the destruction of Exandria, the Prime Deities, represented by Bahumut the Platinum Dragon and Erathis the Lawbearer, descended upon Vasselheim and informed the mortals of their decision: they would depart the world and seal all gods behind a Divine Gate. This would forever prevent any god from acting directly upon Exandria again. No god would ever walk the surface of the world hereafter.

It seems that this decision was not an entirely unanimous one from the Primes, but in short order they all agreed it was the best course of action and left their children to rebuild civilization anew. They returned to their own realms and sealed all their divine powers behind the newly constructed Divine Gate. Only by sealing themselves away as well could they prevent their corrupted brethren from ever physically returning to the Material Plane.

Of course, the gods still influence mortals from behind the Divine Gate, bestowing their knowledge and power on their most devout worshipers, but the path of mortals is ultimately their own to make.

# Part 3: The Origins of Tal’Dorei

The modern calendar begins in the year 0 P.D. (Post-Divergence), and although it took an additional 500 years for the modern nation of Tal’Dorei to be founded, the land at this time held the seeds of the civilizations that exist here today.

## Chapter 6: Gwessar
It was the hardy and dependable dwarves that best weathered the war between gods and mortals, in the tunnels beneath the Cliffkeep Mountains. What began as a leaderless collection of clans in the aftermath of the Calamity ultimately unified into the subterranean city of Kraghammer and came to be led by the first ruling clan, Clan Jaggenstrike. Proud of their new home, the dwarves saw no reason to emerge from the bowels of the earth onto the war-scarred surface of misery and death.

While the dwarves remained underground, a group of elves appeared suddenly in the south. At the outset of the Calamity a society of elves used a powerful and obscure ritual to transport their people to the safety of another plane: the Feywild. The Feywild has been described as a plane of primordial beauty where elven legend says the Arch Heart lovingly fashioned their people before placing them upon the face of Exandria. They returned to Exandria at the turning of ages under the guidance of an elven sorceress named Yenlara Alderwreath. She was known for her defiant strength and compassion in the face of adversity. Under her wise rule, she led her people westward to the Verdant Expanse, an untamed forest born from the residual elemental power of the Calamity. The beauty of their forest home inspired the name of their first settlement: Syngorn. As Yenlara’s people explored beyond the forest they found vast fields of grass emerging from the ashy ground, with tall snow-capped mountains visible on the horizon. The elves named this land Gwessar, the Fields of Joy, which elves and those enamoured with elven-culture still use to describe the continent of Tal’Dorei.

Both dwarves and elves are long-lived people, and while they struggled to rebuild their civilizations, there were those among them who still remembered the world that was. Humanity on the other hand, was not so fortunate. The human histories of the wasteland warlords did not survive the centuries in written form. However, humans themselves somehow endured. After a few hundred years a clan of humans sailed from Issylra, perhaps even from Vasselheim itself, across the angry Ozmit Sea to Gwessar’s western coast. These people had sea in their blood and lept from island to island for generations. The ruins of their first settlement, the port city of O’Noa, still stand today. From this place they expanded their territory to encompass all of the western shores. In the north they found fertile land and began to build. They did not know that their city would become the capital of a great empire, nor did they know the glory and sorrow that would come with it.

## Chapter 7: The Iron Rule of Drassig
The rise of the human colonies irritated the elves of Syngorn. Forests that had stood for centuries fell under the axes of what they considered to be rash, short-lived beings who sought to exploit, expand and propagate thoughtlessly. These tensions did not lead to war, for long are the memories of elves, but humans remained a thorn in the side of elfkind, chafing at their hard-won efforts to protect their newly rebuilt society in their sacred woodlands.

Emon became the first city in this part of the world after the Calamity and gave rise to a handful of self-entitled noble houses who went on to establish civilization in the name of the Lawbearer. But those who dealt the cards had stacked the deck in their favour. Corruption spread through the upper echelons of Emon and power-hungry politicians seized the new and valuable resources that were discovered in the kingdom. They turned citizens against each other, forcing them to fight for scraps while they hoarded the lion’s share. Humans will be humans.

Emon was a political warzone, and the greatest “warrior” of them all was the loudmouthed braggart and cunning oligarch Warren Drassig. He used the chaos and distrust in the city to seize power and transform the realm into the Kingdom of Drassig (somewhere in the mid-to-late 400s P.D.), with Warren himself as its supreme monarch. He was quick to sever any remaining ties to the elves of Syngorn and made new alliances with the dwarves of Kraghammer to gain access to their immense material wealth. The elves were, predictably, furious, but an idealistic grandson of Yenlara hoped to resolve this diplomatic dispute. Upon arrival, and equally predictably, he was apprehended, tortured and slain. This final act of treachery drove Syngorn to take up arms and the continent erupted into a terrible war between Yenlara’s kin and Drassig’s bloodline known as The Scattered War.

## Chapter 8: The Scattered War
The Scattered War lasted for 32 years (beginning somewhere between 479 and 504 P.D. and ending between 511 and 536 P.D.) and is recalled in bardsong in The Time of Shrouds. It spanned across the Cliffkeep Mountains and parts of the Verdant Expanse, with the human colonies spread throughout the warring territories. King Drassig encountered little resistance as he conquered each village, town and city in turn, giving these isolated settlements no way of warning one another of his advance.

Drassig was no common warmonger; he was a cunning, heartless master of psychological warfare. Weeks in advance of his armies, he seeded spies throughout the land. They traveled swiftly and infiltrated settlements throughout the region, turning the people in them against their own leaders, so that by the time the armies arrived, they had been torn apart from the inside. The lights of human towns and elven groves were snuffed out with equal savagery; he wasn’t picky about who he killed and conquered.

A mere nine years into the conflict, King Warren Drassig died at Torthil, an abandoned village in Gwessar’s heartlands. In the previous years rumours had circulated that Torthil was a haven for refugees fleeing Drassig’s conquering armies. The king and his soldiers descended upon the village, ready to slaughter some innocent survivors, but were instead met with an ambush. Regrouping in the town square, Drassig stood among his dwindling forces , blade raised, eyes wild and voice booming, only to be struck in the middle of his wicked speech by a volley of arrows. Yenlara’s elves and the rebellious humans had joined forces and formed an alliance against the tyrannical warlord.

Warren was succeeded by his eldest son, Neminar Drassig. King Neminar shunned the crude, brutal methods of his father, and instead devoted himself to more sinister powers. He became known as “Neminar the Black-Fingered” as his forays into necromancy left one arm withered and tainted. Nevertheless, his weaponization of a magic that was widely considered to be forbidden was successful. Bent on vengeance, he led his army back to Torthil, where the corpses of elves and humans were piled high upon the outer walls. Their pyres ignited the night sky as the entire city was burned to ash. 

The rule of Neminar marked the darkest days of the war. He introduced tactics and magic that drove his soldiers beyond what he considered to be human “limitations”, leaving their bodies altered and mutated by necromancy. Their warped minds craved bloodshed, and their bodies needed no sustenance to fuel their bloodlust. Drassig’s forces became the perfect weapons of war and their ranks were blessed by Bane the Strife Emperor, the Betrayer God of War and Conquest, who was the first Betrayer God to extend his power to mortals beyond the Divine Gate. Through this act the other gods realised that although they could no longer walk upon Exandria, they could still grant power and magic to the faithful.

In the face of this terrible power, the alliance of humans and elves bolstered their ranks with vengeful orphans and eager heroes of all ancetries who had suffered under the Drassigs’ tyranny. One such hero was Zan Tal’Dorei, a human from the harried streets of Syngorn who quickly showed her talent as both a warrior and an inspiring leader. Rallying the broken ranks of the resistance, Zan lured Neminar and his forces into the Verdant Expanse. 

Neminar’s undoing was his arrogant attack upon the Shifting Keep, a Syngornian outpost protected by the slippery magic of the Feywild. The illusory fortress vanished, leaving the Drassig army without a target and, like his father before him, vulnerable to ambush. The forest itself is said to have lent its fury to the weapons of Zan’s warriors and Neminar and his corrupted soldiers were crushed. Word of his defeat spread across Gwessar and the banner of Zan Tal’Dorei’s rebel army became a symbol of hope for all the oppressed peoples of the realm. Even so, the last years of fighting still lay ahead, with the late King Warren Drassig’s youngest son soon to take power and avenge his family.

## Chapter 9: The Druids of the Dawn Circle

King [[Trist Drassig]], second-born son of the despotic Warren Drassig, took the throne with unearned confidence. So enamoured was he with the arrogant visions of victory that he ignored the truth of his tenuous rule: he was neither as brilliant nor as charismatic as his father. Nor was he as talented an arcanist as his brother. His armies were stretched thin, and the people in the kingdom were prone to riots and rebellion. King Trist lost battle after battle to Zan Tal’Dorei and her allies.

Among such allies were the Druids of the Dawn Circle, a group of sun-worshipers. The largely apocryphal text “Nature’s Goddess” argues that all druids derive their magical abilities from Melora. While there is a vast amount of evidence to refute the claim that all natural magics have their root in Melora’s divine power, it does nonetheless seem likely that at least some of the Druids of the Dawn Circle did worship Melora to some extent. Whether this was a founding principle of the group, or, as with modern druidic societies, merely a preference of its more religiously inclined members, is unknown. Whether it was due to Melora’s teachings, or as part of their druidic worship of nature itself, they were disgusted by the tales of corrupted soldiers in the Drassig armies.

Despite being pacifistic people, they joined forces with Zan in one of the many battles on the Dividing Plains and used their druidic powers to drench the remnants of Neminar’s necromantic soldiers, which still made up a large part of the opposing forces, in blinding sunlight, destroying them entirely. Following the battle, the druids retreated to their sanctuary, a place of natural beauty for ritual worship, called [[Shadebarrow]] to regroup and tend to their wounded. King Trist, consumed by rage at the loss of the undead legions, especially since he lacked his brother’s power to create more, followed the druids to their safe haven and in an act of vile brutality slew every living thing in the settlement.

(1) Shadebarrow is also mentioned in “Nature’s Goddess”, however there it is referred to as the “Hanging Gardens of Shadebarrow”. It is unknown what this is in reference to, as all other sources on the subject only state that the druidic site contained a henge. 

## Chapter 10: The Battle of the Umbra Hills

Outraged by this vile act, Zan Tal’Dorei led a righteously invigorated force to avenge the druids and before long, King Trist found his army backed against the imposing base of the Clifkeep Mountains. On the verge of what seemed like certain victory, Zan and her rebels, along with the allied elves of Syngorn, pursued Drassig to this valley but were met with fiends amidst the ranks of their enemy. King Trist had crafted a secret weapon through his brother’s dealings with Bane the Strife Emperor: a legion of demons had joined his forces. 

They spilled onto the battlefield like a river of nightmares and in minutes the surrounding hills ran dark with rivers of blood and ichor, with the bodies of humans and demons alike littering the battlefield. Yet, despite all odds, Zan defeated King Trist, ending the Drassig bloodline, and with it the demonic pact that the Drassigs had made. It is said that the grass and flowers of the Umbra Hills grow black and burnt as an echo of this battle, their sap coursing with fiendish blood that was spilled that day. 

It has also been noted by prominent abyssal researchers that the use of demons by King Trist in the Battle of the Umbra Hills caused such a stir in the depths of the Abyss that it subsequently drew the attention of several demon princes to this region of Tal’Dorei, among them Graz’zt the Demon Prince of Pleasure and Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath.
