Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement by a warlock)

---

_You have agreed to be your Patron's Charismatic Champion in the battle ahead and new abilities have been bestowed upon you and your Book of Shadows._

While holding this Tome, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your warlock spells. In addition, you can regain one warlock spell slot as an action. You can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.

You also have advantage on all Charisma ability checks and creatures you target with a charm spell (see list) have disadvantage on their saving throw.
