Titania has appreciated the chaos that you bring to the group. Not to mention your gallant behaviour to "Bianca Caliban". She has therefore granted you a little boon in the form of her Pocket of Nonsense. A small green green silk pouch with interwoven golden thread that can be tied to your belt.

As an action Chip (and only Chip) can pull an object from the pouch. The item lasts for 1 hour or until used before vanishing. 

- **Buk Buk Buk Ba-gawk Motherf*cker**: A rubber chicken appears in your hand, ready to attack your enemies (assuming you hit them with it). The rubber chicken is an improvised weapon which does 1d6 bludgeoning damage to the target. On a hit with this weapon the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

- **Sparkly Sparkly**: Twinkling lights form in a 15 ft radius centred on you. All creatures you choose make a Wisdom saving throw )DC 15) or are **charmed** until the end of their next turn. As they are charmed they ooh and aah at the pretty lights.

- **Eye Spy**: An eyeball that looks a bit like a stress ball. When squeezed it allows you to see invisible creatures for 1 minute. However, the eyeball screams as you squeeze it.

- **BIRDS BIRDS BIRDS**: A swarm of origami birds swirl into the air in a 10 ft burst. They lightly obscure the area and give advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide for 1 minute.

Once used, the Pocket of Nonsense cannot be used until the next dawn.
