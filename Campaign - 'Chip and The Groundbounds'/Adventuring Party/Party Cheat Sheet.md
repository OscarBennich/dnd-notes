| Evan      | Reaction     | Misty Escape     | When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Ossian    | Reaction     | Counterspell     | You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.<br><br>**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used. |
| Ossian    | N/A          | Tides of Chaos   | You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.<br><br>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Ossian    | Reaction     | Bend Luck        | When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Dain      | Reaction     | Clarity of Catha | When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Chip      | Reaction     | Deflect Missiles | You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.<br><br>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.                                    |
| Chip      | N/A          | Evasion          | Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Narissa   | Reaction     | Uncanny Dodge    | When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Narissa   | N/A          | Evasion          | You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Mads      | Reaction     | Hellish Rebuke   | You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mads      | Reaction     | Protective Wings | You can manifest protective wings that can shield you or others. When you or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to manifest spectral wings from your back for a moment. You grant a bonus to the target’s AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                           |

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fey Ancestry      | You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fey Presence      | Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. |
| Misty Escape      | When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Telekenetic Shove | As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.                                                                                                                                                |
| Repelling Blast   | When you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [[Hat of Disguise]]        | While wearing this hat, you can cast the Disguise Self spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Oil of Etherealness        | One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.                                                                                                                  |

| Disk of Direction          | A weathered metal disk with Elvish script on the back. While holding this disk you can use an action to determine which way is north. This property functions only on the Material Plane.<br><br>If you touch the disk to an object and speak the command word, it will instead point to the object. If you speak the command word again the connection will be severed and the arrow on the disk point towards north instead. |
| Pot of Awakening           | If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened shrub at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Wand of Conducting         | This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Mage Armor                | 1st   | You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Dissonant Whispers        | 1st   | You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.<br><br>**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Chaos Bolt                | 1st   | You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below<br><br>**At Higher Levels**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d6 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Invisibility              | 2nd   | A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.<br><br>**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Misty Step                | 2nd   | Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Scorching Ray             | 2nd   | You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.<br><br>Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.<br><br>**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Counterspell              | 3rd   | You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.<br><br>**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Fireball                  | 3rd   | A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.<br><br>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.<br><br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.

| Moonbeam              | 2nd   | A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.<br><br>When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.<br><br>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.<br><br>_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Hypnotic Pattern      | 3rd   | You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration.

| Major Image           | 3rd   | You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench).<br><br>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.<br><br>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.<br><br>**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration. |

Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the target's person.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Hallucinatory Terrain | 4th   | You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.<br><br>The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Locate Creature       | 4th   | Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the creature's location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement.<br><br>The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such a creature up close--within 30 feet--at least once. If the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of a **polymorph** spell, this spell doesn't locate the creature.<br><br>This spell can't locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Harness Divine Power                        | You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Channel Divinity: Turn Undead               | Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold |
| Channel Divinity: Blessing of the Full Moon | As an action, you instill a willing creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that you can see with one of the following blessings of your choice:<br><br>Blessing of the Watchful Moon. For 1 hour, the blessed creature’s speed increases by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks involving smell or made to track a creature.<br><br>Blessing of the Blood-Drenched Moon. For 10 minutes, the blessed creature has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the blessed creature’s allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t incapacitated.                                                                                                             |
| Channel Divinity: Mind of Two Moons         | You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the twofold arcana of Exandria’s moons. By expending one use of Channel Divinity, you can cast a second concentration spell while already concentrating on a first spell, as long as both spells are on your list of Moon Domain spells. If you need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both spells, you make the save with disadvantage. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Destroy Undead                              | Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Clarity of Catha                            | When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Martial Arts          | You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:<br><br>- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.<br><br>- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.<br><br>- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. |
| Ki Points (1 / level) | Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.  You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. <br><br>- Flurry of Blows: Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.<br><br>- Patient Defense: You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br>- Step of the Wind: You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.                                                                                                                                              |
| Unarmored Movement    | Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.<br><br>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Deflect Missiles      | You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.<br><br>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Slow Fall             | You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Stunning Strike       | You can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ki-Empowered Strikes  | Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Evasion               | Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Sneak Attack           | Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra **4d6** damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.<br><br>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.<br><br>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Uncanny Dodge          | When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Whispers of the Dead   | Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you.

| Wails from the Grave   | Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the roll's total.<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Evasion                | You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Tokens of the Departed | At 9th level, when a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form: as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the _Player's Handbook_ to generate it.<br><br>You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.<br><br>You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:<br><br>- While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object.<br><br>- When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of that feature.<br><br>- As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM. |

Each of these creatures takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form.<br><br>**_At Higher Levels._** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.                                                                                                                                                             |

You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.<br><br>In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the Entangle spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Aberrant Dragonmark         | - Ray of Frost<br>- False Life<br><br>When you cast the 1st-level spell through your mark, you can expend one of your Hit Dice and roll it. If you roll an even number, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the number rolled. If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Gift of the Metallic Dragon | **Draconic Healing.** You learn the Cure Wounds spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot. Once you cast this spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have. The spell’s spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you cast it with this feat (choose when you gain the feat).<br><br>**Protective Wings.** You can manifest protective wings that can shield you or others. When you or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to manifest spectral wings from your back for a moment. You grant a bonus to the target’s AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
