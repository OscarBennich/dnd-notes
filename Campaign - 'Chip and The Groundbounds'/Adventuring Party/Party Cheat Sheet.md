| Fey Ancestry      | You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fey Presence      | Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. |
| Misty Escape      | When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Telekenetic Shove | As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.                                                                                                                                                |
| Repelling Blast   | When you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| [[Hat of Disguise]]        | While wearing this hat, you can cast the Disguise Self spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Bag of Beans               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Oil of Etherealness        | One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.                                                                                                                  |

| Disk of Direction          | A weathered metal disk with Elvish script on the back. While holding this disk you can use an action to determine which way is north. This property functions only on the Material Plane.<br><br>If you touch the disk to an object and speak the command word, it will instead point to the object. If you speak the command word again the connection will be severed and the arrow on the disk point towards north instead. |
| Pot of Awakening           | If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an awakened shrub at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Wand of Conducting         | This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to a range of 60 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Mage Armor                | 1st   | You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Dissonant Whispers        | 1st   | You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.<br><br>At Higher Levels.

You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.                                                                                                                          |

| Harness Divine Power                        | You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Channel Divinity: Turn Undead               | Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold |
| Channel Divinity: Blessing of the Full Moon | As an action, you instill a willing creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that you can see with one of the following blessings of your choice:<br><br>Blessing of the Watchful Moon. For 1 hour, the blessed creature’s speed increases by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks involving smell or made to track a creature.<br><br>Blessing of the Blood-Drenched Moon. For 10 minutes, the blessed creature has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the blessed creature’s allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t incapacitated.                                                                                                             |
| Channel Divinity: Mind of Two Moons         | You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the twofold arcana of Exandria’s moons. By expending one use of Channel Divinity, you can cast a second concentration spell while already concentrating on a first spell, as long as both spells are on your list of Moon Domain spells. If you need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both spells, you make the save with disadvantage. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Destroy Undead                              | Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Clarity of Catha                            | When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Bead of Force                | You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.<br><br>An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside. |

The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named.<br><br>Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Martial Arts            | You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:<br><br>- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.<br><br>- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.<br><br>- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. |
| Ki Points               | Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.  You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. <br><br>- Flurry of Blows: Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.<br><br>- Patient Defense: You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br>- Step of the Wind: You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.                                                                                                                                              |
| Unarmored Movement      | Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.<br><br>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Deflect Missiles        | You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.<br><br>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Slow Fall               | You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Stunning Strike         | You can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ki-Empowered Strikes    | Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Open Hand Technique     | Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:<br><br>- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.<br><br>- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.<br><br>- It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Wholeness of Body       | You gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Evasion                 | Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Stillness of Mind       | You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Fey Ancestry          | You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Sneak Attack          | Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra **4d6** damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.<br><br>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.<br><br>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table. |
| Cunning Action        | Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Steady Aim (Optional) | As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Uncanny Dodge         | When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Whispers of the Dead  | Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you. You lose this proficiency when you use this feature to choose a different proficiency that you lack.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Wails from the Grave  | Immediately after you deal your Sneak Attack damage to a creature on your turn, you can target a second creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. Roll half the number of Sneak Attack dice for your level (round up), and the second creature takes necrotic damage equal to the roll's total.<br><br>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                |
| Evasion               | You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Hat of Vermin          | This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and speak a command word that summons your choice of a bat, a frog, or a rat (see the Player's Handbook or the Monster Manual for statistics). The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is neither friendly nor hostile, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 hit points. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn. |
| Healer's Kit           | This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
