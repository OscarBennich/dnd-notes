| Evan      | Reaction     | Misty Escape       | When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Evan      | Reaction     | Beguiling Defenses | You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Ossian    | Reaction     | Counterspell       | You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.<br><br>**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used. |
| Ossian    | N/A          | Tides of Chaos     | You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.<br><br>Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.                                                                                                                                                      |
| Ossian    | Reaction     | Bend Luck          | When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Dain      | Reaction     | Clarity of Catha   | When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Chip      | Reaction     | Deflect Missiles   | You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.<br><br>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.                                    |
| Chip      | N/A          | Evasion            | Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Narissa   | Reaction     | Uncanny Dodge      | When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Narissa   | N/A          | Evasion            | You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an Ice Storm spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Mads      | Reaction     | Hellish Rebuke     | You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><br>_**At Higher Levels.**_ When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Mads      | Reaction     | Protective Wings   | You can manifest protective wings that can shield you or others. When you or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to manifest spectral wings from your back for a moment. You grant a bonus to the target’s AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                           |

| Fey Ancestry       | You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fey Presence       | Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.<br><br>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. |
| Misty Escape       | When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Beguiling Defenses | You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Telekenetic Shove  | As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.                                                                                                                                                |
| Repelling Blast    | When you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Harness Divine Power                        | You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to fuel your spells. As a bonus action, you touch your holy symbol, utter a prayer, and regain one expended spell slot, the level of which can be no higher than half your proficiency bonus (rounded up). The number of times you can use this feature is based on the level you've reached in this class: 2nd level, once; 6th level, twice; and 18th level, thrice. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Channel Divinity: Turn Undead               | Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action. When an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold |
| Channel Divinity: Blessing of the Full Moon | As an action, you instill a willing creature of your choice within 30 feet of you that you can see with one of the following blessings of your choice:<br><br>Blessing of the Watchful Moon. For 1 hour, the blessed creature’s speed increases by 10 feet, and it has advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks involving smell or made to track a creature.<br><br>Blessing of the Blood-Drenched Moon. For 10 minutes, the blessed creature has advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of the blessed creature’s allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t incapacitated.                                                                                                             |
| Channel Divinity: Mind of Two Moons         | You can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the twofold arcana of Exandria’s moons. By expending one use of Channel Divinity, you can cast a second concentration spell while already concentrating on a first spell, as long as both spells are on your list of Moon Domain spells. If you need to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration on both spells, you make the save with disadvantage. On a failure, you lose concentration on both spells.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Destroy Undead                              | Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Clarity of Catha                            | When a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see makes a Wisdom saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant that creature advantage on the save. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Empowered Cantrips                          | Starting at 8th level, your cleric cantrips deal extra damage equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Divine Intervention                         | Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate. If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Martial Arts          | You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:<br><br>- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.<br><br>- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.<br><br>- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. |
| Ki Points (1 / level) | Your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. You can spend these points to fuel various ki features.  You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind. <br><br>- Flurry of Blows: Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.<br><br>- Patient Defense: You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.<br><br>- Step of the Wind: You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.                                                                                                                                              |
| Unarmored Movement    | Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.<br><br>At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Deflect Missiles      | You can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.<br><br>If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Slow Fall             | You can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Stunning Strike       | You can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ki-Empowered Strikes  | Your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Evasion               | Your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Stillness of Mind     | You can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.<br><br>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.<br><br>The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Cunning Action         | Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat.

| Steady Aim (Optional)  | As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you haven't moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Whispers of the Dead   | Whenever you finish a short or long rest, you can gain one skill or tool proficiency of your choice, as a ghostly presence shares its knowledge with you.

When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Tokens of the Departed | At 9th level, when a life ends in your presence, you're able to snatch a token from the departing soul, a sliver of its life essence that takes physical form: as a reaction when a creature you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can open your free hand and cause a Tiny trinket to appear there, a soul trinket. The DM determines the trinket's form or has you roll on the Trinkets table in the _Player's Handbook_ to generate it.<br><br>You can have a maximum number of soul trinkets equal to your proficiency bonus, and you can't create one while at your maximum.<br><br>You can use soul trinkets in the following ways:<br><br>- While a soul trinket is on your person, you have advantage on death saving throws and Constitution saving throws, for your vitality is enhanced by the life essence within the object.<br><br>- When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your turn, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets that's on your person and then immediately use Wails from the Grave, without expending a use of that feature.<br><br>- As an action, you can destroy one of your soul trinkets, no matter where it's located. When you do so, you can ask the spirit associated with the trinket one question. The spirit appears to you and answers in a language it knew in life. It's under no obligation to be truthful, and it answers as concisely as possible, eager to be free. The spirit knows only what it knew in life, as determined by the DM. |

| Darkvision                  | Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
