- A group of sun-worshiping Druids

[[A History of Tal’Dorei]]:
The largely apocryphal text “Nature’s Goddess” argues that all druids derive their magical abilities from Melora. While there is a vast amount of evidence to refute the claim that all natural magics have their root in Melora’s divine power, it does nonetheless seem likely that at least some of the Druids of the Dawn Circle did worship Melora to some extent. Whether this was a founding principle of the group, or, as with modern druidic societies, merely a preference of its more religiously inclined members, is unknown. Whether it was due to Melora’s teachings, or as part of their druidic worship of nature itself, they were disgusted by the tales of corrupted soldiers in the [[Trist Drassig|Drassig]] armies.

Despite being pacifistic people, they joined forces with Zan in one of the many battles on the Dividing Plains and used their druidic powers to drench the remnants of Neminar’s necromantic soldiers, which still made up a large part of the opposing forces, in blinding sunlight, destroying them entirely. Following the battle, the druids retreated to their sanctuary, a place of natural beauty for ritual worship, called [[Shadebarrow]] to regroup and tend to their wounded. [[Trist Drassig|King Trist|]], consumed by rage at the loss of the undead legions, especially since he lacked his [[Neminar Drassig|brother]]’s power to create more, followed the druids to their safe haven and in an act of vile brutality slew every living thing in the settlement.
