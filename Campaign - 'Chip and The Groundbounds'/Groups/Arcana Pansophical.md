In the Eternal interest of the Preservation of Harmony within the realm of Exandria, we the Arcana Pansophical establish the Truth of Magic, and three Edicts from which none shall stray. Those Arcanists found in gross violation of the Truth will be punished by the full extent of this Order - outside of any local law.

Though the school of Necromancy shall be restricted to none in the interest of magical study and Understanding, the animation of the dead is a Violation of the Truth.

The Arcane is a tool to be wielded for the good of the People. To use its Power in pursuit of wanton Destruction or unjust Murder is a Violation of the Truth.

In addition, though the Jurisdiction of the Pansophical supersedes the power of local laws, a mage who willfully breaks the laws of the land is in Violation of the Truth.
