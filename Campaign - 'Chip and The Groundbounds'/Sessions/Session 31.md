	- It is a [[Periapt of Wound Closure]]

- Billiam has heard a rumor that someone high up in [[The League of Miracles]] is working with [[The Clasp]]
	- Can we find evidence of the direct link of this? âž¡ [[Find connection between The League of Miracles and the Clasp|new quest]]!
- Debt is used as leverage from the league against the council
- This would be evidence that the league is a criminal organization
- Billiam wants this for the good of [[Westruun]] (...?)
- We need to be discrete
- I buy the Billiam boys a round of ale
