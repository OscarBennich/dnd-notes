**Next steps**
- (1) Find a way to get out of [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s magical lab
- (2) Try to decipher the letter using the "*The Craftsmanship of an Agreement*" book we found
- (3) Find [[Honor Kinnabari]] again and tell her what we've found
- (4) Go back to [[Caliban House]] and eat together with [[Duchess Bianca Caliban]]
- (5) Go back to [[Billiam Christ]] with evidence of the collusion between The League and The Clasp:
	- The deed for the Leatherworking store that's been signed by Dragomir Lunthak
	- The story from [[Tristan Stonesworn]] about what goes on at the store
		- Including information from the ledger we found, i.e. "Additional shop loan payments"
	- The dumbwaiter leading to the Clasp hideout, "Upstairs" from the store
	- Anything we potentially find in the deciphered letter
	- Other information about The Dragon attack, The [[Nullifier]], and The Magma Landshark attacks
- (6) Figure out more about what the exact meaning of the [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|text we found]] (written by Dragomir): "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the Planar Scythe. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the Shadow¬†That¬†Was.*"
	- What is "the Planar Scythe"? Is it a weapon?
	- What is the bargain they made with Luella?
	- Releasing the *Shadow That Was* - could that be referring to [[Neminar Drassig]]?
	- Maybe we could find out more at the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
- (7) Try to confront Dragomir?

	- A jar of dust
	- The skull of a lizard
	- A box with an eyeball encased in a gem
	- A jar of small black pearls
	- A broken bone
	- A small square of black silk
- [[Theo]] smells the skull of the lizard

	- It's a diamond worth 500g! üíé
- Narissa and I, look through the books that are on a shelf above one the desk
	- [INSERT BOOK NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS HERE]
		- All of these books seem very connected to [[Shadebarrow]] (necromancy, druids, The Abyss)
		- This confirms (ish) that [[Dragomir Lunthak]] is connected to more than just what's happening in [[Westruun]]...
	- Including one book regarding what's basically cryogenic freezing
- I put all books of interest in our *Bag of Holding* to research at a later date
- We try to touch an "E" in one of the books - nothing happens
- I start saying the inscription from the locket: *To eternity...* while holding the book, and I vanish
- Everyone else does the same thing, holding the book and saying "Eternity"
- We all appear back in Dragomir's office, behind his desk

	- A timetable for the events at the ball (excluding the speech from the Matron of Raven's priestesses and the dragon attack)
	- A map of Westruun
	- A list of spell components
	- Incomplete spell scrolls in his trash
- Chip hears someone coming in the corridor
- We all run out of the room, hide in a little alcove between the doors, put the *Major Image* in front of us, and try to quietly hide (stealth check)
- We hear someone coming, knocking, opening the door and walking into [[Ashcombe Paltimore]]'s office (we do not recognize the voice), scribbling something and then leaving
- I pop back in to the office and check what he wrote:
	- "*Come find me when you're back, I've got a question for you Lunthak about some of [[Honor Kinnabari]]'s work. Seems to be free of charge?*" - [[Tarron Sarastina]]
- We leave the offices and go back through the corridor and down the stairs
- [[Cecilia Brightwater]] greets us

- We arrive back at [[Caliban House]]
- [[Perdita Thimblegrin Quickgleem]] greets us - "You're back!"
- She leads us to our rooms on the upper floor
- Two corridors lined with doors to our rooms, one for each of us. We get to construct our own rooms üòç (out-of-character)
- Corridor #1:
	- [[Chip]]
	- [[Evan]]
- Corridor #2:
	- [[Dain]]
	- [[Ossian]]
	- [[Mads]]
	- [[Narissa]]
- The party reconvenes in my room
- I start identifying some of the items we found
	- The silver ritual knife that radiates a faint necrotic energy:
		- It's not a magical item *per se* but I know its something you would use for necromantic rituals
	- A large pearl, shimmering unusually:
		- It's a [[Pearl of Power]]!
		- I take this, equip it and attune to it
- I investigate the scrolls from [[Ashcombe Paltimore]]'s office (Arcana check, 14)
	- All I get is the type of magic - transmutation / conjuration

	- Tell him about all we've found regarding the [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|collusion]]

	- Ask him about confronting [[Dragomir Lunthak]]
- We finish our conversation and head downstairs to eat dinner with [[Duchess Bianca Caliban]]
- The chef is carrying in plates - he's called [[Usko]]
- We sit down
- There's a huge, delicious feast on the table
- Bianca proposes a toast but is suddenly interrupted by the voice of my [[Patron]] ([[Queen Titania]])!
	- "*To forms truer than flesh, to the instincts we hide behind silk and silver. Let me see you dance without your disguises dears.*"
- Our vision turns multi-colored - like looking through a soap bubble
- We feel sick, and suddenly we wake up in a maze in the garden outside (there wasn't a maze there before?)
- We look around and realize *we've all been transformed into pigs*
	- We can cast spells but if it takes an Action they take 1 minute to cast instead
	- We have 12 AC and 4 HP
	- 30 feet movement
- A Bianca-themed pig is trapped in a cage on a pillar in the middle of the maze
- We go right and reach a dead-end with a wolf
- We go back and find a mask with raven feathers on the ground
	- Narissa puts it on
	- She vanishes
- We find a sheep with golden wool that's flipped over
	- We help it get up
- We find another mask that glows with the light of the moon
	- Instead of putting it on, Dain puts in his mouth to carry it with us
- We encounter a pond with a bunch of frogs
- We find another mask, shadow and starlight - Mads'?
- We encounter a gecko - I give him my glasses
- We find another mask with flickering green flames - Mine?
- We come upon another pig with a beret who is painting
	- He's painting a scene from [[Queen Titania]]'s court, the summer court
- We find another mask, covered in vines
- We find the pillar in the middle, a key, and another mask
- We let Pig-Bianca out of her cage but there's no mask for her
- She wants us to put on our masks anyway, she says that letting her out of the cage might be "the end" of the maze
- We put on our masks and vanish and each of us hear a voice in our heads
	- I hear: "*Stop being such an ass, charm the people you need, and be mischievous with those that you don't. Not the other way around!*"
- The 6 of us are transported back to the dinner table again
- But Bianca is still a pig...
- We follow Bianca to the garden and she writes a message in the dirt with her snout
- She tells us she will get help from [[Gilmore]] in the morning and hopefully he'll be able to help
- I try to help by casting *Dispel Magic* (5th level) on her, but it does nothing
- With nothing left to do for now, we head to bed
- During the night, I hear a soft voice: "Evan..."
	- I make a WIS saving throw (16)
- The voice seems to be coming from downstairs, I'm drawn to it
- I head back to the dining room and out to the terrace
- In the garden I see a elvish (?) woman with pointed ears and sharp angular features
- She's wearing a gown of green and gold
- Long curls of copper hair cascading down
- Eyes that shine through the night with golden light
- As her eyes meet mine, my vision narrows to only her face
- She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for me to follow her and walks away slowly
- I feel a tugging motion and follow her
- As I turn the corner I'm suddenly in a forest clearing
- From when we first met, but slightly different
- There's bright orange flowers, and I could *swear* I hear snoring coming from them
- There's a silver pool of water in front of me with a stepped waterfall
- There's a tree to the right with dark emerald leaves
- The woman leaps from lily pad to lily pad
- She conjures a thrown made of vines, seemingly looking almost like a sleeping dragon
- In the center of the pool and directly in front of the pool is a larger lily pad
- She tells me that if I want to speak to her I need to "take the stage"
- There's strange birds in the trees and other strange critters
- The only way to get to the big lily bad is to leap across the water
	- Acrobatics check ‚û°Ô∏è 16
- I successfully jump across and soon stand before her - "You wanted to meet me, here I am..."
- I see visions of different people:
	- [[Portia]]
	- [[Juliette]]
	- Miranda from [[Turst Fields]]
	- [[Desdemona]]
	- [[Madame Maab]]
	- Rosalind from [[Westhall Academy]] in [[Westruun]]
- "The main problem with the mortal world is the lack of spontaneity"
- "There's someone I don't like very much"
	- [[Dragomir Lunthak]] is the one whose trying to release this entity
	- It's [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]??
	- "He took someone who belonged to me"
	- A well-endowed druid, killed in [[Shadebarrow]]
	- "I don't like when my belongings are tampered with."
- She snaps her fingers and the lily pad I was standing on collapses
- She asks me to choose:
	- ...
	- ...
	- ...
- As a gift from my [[Patron]], my *Tome of Shadow* is transformed into xxx
- The session ends...
