**Next steps**
- (1) Find a way to get out of [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s magical lab
- (2) Try to decipher the letter using the "*The Craftsmanship of an Agreement*" book we found
- (3) Find [[Honor Kinnabari]] again and tell her what we've found
- (4) Go back to [[Caliban Manor]] and eat together with [[Duchess Bianca Caliban]]
- (5) Go back to [[Billiam Christ]] with evidence of the collusion between The League and The Clasp:
	- The deed for the Leatherworking store that's been signed by Dragomir Lunthak
	- The story from [[Tristan Stonesworn]] about what goes on at the store
		- Including information from the ledger we found, i.e. "Additional shop loan payments"
	- The dumbwaiter leading to the Clasp hideout, "Upstairs" from the store
	- Anything we potentially find in the deciphered letter
	- Other information about The Dragon attack, The [[Nullifier]], and The Magma Landshark attacks
- (6) Figure out more about what the exact meaning of the [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|text we found]] (written by Dragomir): "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the Planar Scythe. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the Shadow That Was.*"
	- What is "the Planar Scythe"? Is it a weapon?
	- What is the bargain they made with Luella?
	- Releasing the *Shadow That Was* - could that be referring to [[Neminar Drassig]]?
	- Maybe we could find out more at the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
- (7) Try to confront Dragomir?
