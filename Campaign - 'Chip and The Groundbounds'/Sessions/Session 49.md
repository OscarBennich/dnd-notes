**Next steps**
1. Go back to [[Billiam Christ]] with [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|evidence of the collusion between The League and The Clasp]]
2. Find/buy/make a gilded flower (worth at least 300g) for my *Summon Fey* spell
3. Read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and The Abyss for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
4. Figure out more about what the exact meaning of the [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|text we found]] (written by Dragomir): "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the Planar Scythe. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the Shadow¬†That¬†Was.*" (dated ~ 2 days ago)
	- What is "the Planar Scythe"? Is it a weapon?
	- What is the bargain they made with Luella?
	- Releasing the *Shadow That Was* - That is probably referring to [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] as my [[Patron]] said that Dragomir is trying to "release" him
	- Maybe we could find out more at the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
5. Find out more information about [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]
	- See [[Help Titania stop Dragomir from releasing Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]

- We start the session by waking up in our beds
- We head downstairs and see [[Duchess Bianca Caliban]], she has been turned back to her normal form by [[Gilmore]]

	- CHA saving throw
	- We can choose to fail it (I do)
- We all put on the masks and fall unconscious
	- But not me, I reach for my mask and it vanishes
- "This book of yours, it has an extra gift."
- She takes out a deck of tarot cards and explains my story
- My *Book of Shadows* is now a [[Tome of the Pact Keeper]] (+1)

	- Narissa
	- Mads
	- Ossian

**Ossian's dream**
- Fire
- Garris' face
- Wreathed in flame
- A whisper: "Remember..."
- He stands before a pool in the summer glow (The Summer Court?)

- His parents deposited him here and left?
- *Trial of Fire* in *The Burning Vale*?
- Someone casts *Modify Memory*
- He now stands on a lily pad before Titania
- "Seek revenge if you will..."
- "...or find some way to master the tempest..."
- "...or do nothing. But inaction may have graver consequences than any choice."
- (Harshal will choose later)

**Dain's dream**
- ...
- Dain is granted the *Moon-bitten* feat
  
**Narissa's dream**
- Night. The world is in dark hues of gray and black.
- A dark surface, stretching out forever.
- A single towering tree. Each leaf swallowing light like an infinite void.
- Narissa walks towards it.
- Some of the leaves are falling - are they leaves?
	- Perception check ‚û°Ô∏è 12
- They're not leaves, they're black feathers
- Visions appear in black pools on the ground
	- Our father kneeling
	- Me looking at Narissa with sadness and disappointment
	- The Raven Queen weeping blood
- "You and your lady both wear many masks..." - Titania
- "What does it mean to be chosen by the God of Death?"
- ...
- A small table covered in black velvet appears
- Three tarot cards appear as well:
	- An Elf with a star above her head
	- The Raven Queen
	- A Warrior
- Titania offers a gift, a silver chalice appears on the table
- "Will you drink?"
- In the chalice is a deep-purple liquid, it smells like lavender
- Narissa drinks a sip - it's like drinking ice
- Narissa gets a new feat: *Sister of the Pact-Bound*
	- Narissa has resistance to any spells I cast
	- Once per day she can disrupt (Counterspell) a spell I'm casting
	- Each time Narissa lies to me she takes 2d4+2 damage

**Mad's dream**
- "Now, what do I do with you?"
- She's in a dark void, she sees nothing, feels nothing
- A light flickers before her
- She's seated in a chair in front of a velvet clothed table
- A crystal ball sits on top it

- "If he asks you to join him, will you?"
	- Mads: "No."
- "What is it you wish to know?"
- Mads: "What can you tell me that would help us fight the army of the dead?"
	- Good to have a Cleric
	- Daylight and Radiant damage
	- Holy water
	- The creature he seeks to unleash is a Demon Prince of undeath, if you stop him he remains imprisoned,
	- If he succeeds you will be fighting a being that does not call this plane home, and can only be killed on it's own plane
- Mads: "Is my father responsible for the army of the dead"
	- Yes and no, this being ([[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]) is
	- As Lunthak is trying to free him from the pocket dimension he is currently in, the undead presence is increasing 
- Mads: "How to I defeat my father?"
	- That I cannot tell you.
	- How do you defeat any mortal?
- Mads: "Is my mother alive?"
	- I could find out.
- Titania floats down to Mads' lily pad
- Titania: "I could offer you some protection - for a price."
- She blows a kiss at Mads' and she is granted the feat *Summersworn*
	- Advantage on saving throws against being charmed

	- 1: The world is cruel - and you could be too.
	- 2: Or you could sacrifice yourself for those you love
- Both would give you power, but all deals come with a price...
