**Next steps**
1. Go back to [[Billiam Christ]] with [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|evidence of the collusion between The League and The Clasp]]
2. Find/buy/make a gilded flower (worth at least 300g) for my *Summon Fey* spell
3. Read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and The Abyss for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
4. Figure out more about what the exact meaning of the [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|text we found]] (written by Dragomir): "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the Planar Scythe. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the Shadow That Was.*"
	- What is "the Planar Scythe"? Is it a weapon?
	- What is the bargain they made with Luella?
	- Releasing the *Shadow That Was* - That is probably referring to [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] as my [[Patron]] said that Dragomir is trying to "release" him
	- Maybe we could find out more at the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
5. Find out more information about [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]  ([[Help Titania stop Dragomir from releasing Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]])
