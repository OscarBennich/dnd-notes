- We are now level 2! ðŸŽ‰
- We wake up in [[Mudchute]]
- During the night a [[Patron|weird dream voice]] spoke to me. It sounded like a woman's voice. She spoke about being all-seeing. I kind of recognize the voice?
- Outside the tavern we ran into a weird bird creature the likes of which I have never seen before.
- This bird creature turned out to be an "Aarakocra"
- The Aarakocra is called [[Chip]]. He has come here [[Find the magical storm|looking for a magical storm]] which is somehow connected to a threat to his home.

- We spoke to [[Lawkeeper Owen]] who gave us a quest to [[Clear the north road from monsters]]
- We also got a quest from [[Madame Saunton]] to [[Transport cart to Stilben]]

- We then went to bed in the the tavern and headed out in the morning
