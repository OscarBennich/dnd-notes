```
My dearest dazzling adventurers,

It has come to my attention that you have caused quite a ruckus in this fair city during the past fortnight. I do admire a bit of boldness, especially when laced with a touch of ruin and a dash of mystery.

I am therefore absolutely delighted to formally and personally invite you to stay at my humble lodgings here in Westruun, Caliban House. We are overdue a proper conversation, and I would love you to regale me with all your stories. 

I must apologise profusely for the delay in sending off this invitation; it has been some time since I last had guests and it has taken a while to prepare the house. I‚Äôve had the west wing aired and the mirrors turned inward, the better to see yourselves, naturally. The gardens are in bloom and the dining room is terribly dramatic this time of year.

I have a few amusements prepared. A puzzle or two. A conversation or three. A little truth. A little art. Perhaps even a favour, if one of you impresses me.

You are welcome to stay as long as you like. A house is so very empty without guests, and I suspect you are all growing a little tired of secrets whispered through doors and behind veils.

Looking forward to blinding you with my beauty once more,
Duchess¬†Bianca¬†Caliban

- We send a letter to [[Honor Kinnabari]], inviting her to join us in [[B√§kerz Bakery]] and talk
	- See [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp]]
- We head to [[Caliban House]] and knock on the door
- [[Stefano]] greets us and ushers us in
- We enter into the hallway, stone tile floor, wooden walls, almost a mosaic on the floors
- The undersides of the steps are visible
- Large golden mirror on the wall to our left
- Beautifully decorated, but weird
- [[Duchess Bianca Caliban]] greets us - "My darlings, how nice of you to come!"
	- In a deep purple silk dress

- Bianca asks how we've been - [[Chip]] tells her, including the experience at [[The Old Peculiar]] bar
- Bianca has also met [[Madame Maab]]
- Bianca has prepared a game for us - a puzzle
	- There's a number of items on a table and we need to pick the one we think represents Bianca the best
- There's 3 distinct pairs of magical items:
	- A crown & a mirror
	- A music box & an hourglass w/ crimson grains
		- The music box has an eternal flame burning inside
	- A single silver-healed shoe & a vase of beautiful red roses
- A gnome woman walks into the room
	- [[Perdita Thimblegrin Quickgleem (Grinny)]]
- Pair 1: We pick the mirror - Correct ‚úÖ
- Pair 2: We pick the music box - Incorrect ‚ùå
- Pair 3: We pick the silver-healed shoe - Correct ‚úÖ
	- We did it!
