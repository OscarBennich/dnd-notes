**Next steps**
1. Start travelling to [[Lyrengorn]]
	- Go north out of [[Westruun]], on the *Blackvalley Path* until we get to [[Jorenn Village]]. We then continue north, passing [[Umbra Hills]], continuing through *The Grey Valley* and the *Cliffkeep Mountains* until we get to Lyrengorn.
2. On the way there, I should read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and [[The Abyss]] for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
3. Open questions regarding Orcus:
	- When, where, how, and why was he imprisoned in this pocket dimension? And by whom?
	- Why *exactly* is it related to [[Shadebarrow]]? Was it there it happened?
---
- I sell my *Silver Ritual Knife* for 150g in [[Westruun]]
- Narissa tells [[Ansel B√§ker]] that we're leaving and that we'll be fine (Deception check ‚û°Ô∏è 27)
- We take a long rest to prepare for tomorrow
- The next day, we start heading out of [[Westruun]]
- We start heading north on the *Blackvalley Path*
- It's the day before midsummer and it's peaceful, warm, beautiful
- It will take us ~10 days to reach [[Jorenn Village]]
- After 5 days, around our campfire, I begin a discussion about [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]. What we know and what we don't.
	- Retcon: In [[Session 48]], Titania was supposed to also say that the Druid that "belonged" to her was part of a Druidic ritual that imprisoned Orcus in a pocket dimension
		- So that answers the *who* question
	- The timeline currently doesn't make sense that the druids performed the ritual in [[Shadebarrow]] because they should have been dead even before the battle of [[Umbra Hills]] drew Orcus' attention? 
	- But maybe *other* druids went back there and performed the ritual later?
	- Ask [[Keyleth]] about [[Shadebarrow]] and Orcus?
- Day 7:
	- [[Narissa]] sees something hanging from a tree
	- It seems to be a sack
	- She says she's going to the bathroom and her *Sister of the Pact-Bound* triggers as she lies to me and she takes 7 damage
	- There's a bunch of writing on the sack - all of them say "Gold"
	- She sees that the area beneath seems loose, it's a spike trap
	- [[Ossian]] uses a *Mage hand* to write **not** on the bag with red dye
	- We move on...
- Day 9:
	- We hear the distant rumble of thunder
	- Soon it becomes a fully fledged summer storm
	- We find shelter and lose half a days' travel
- Day 11: We arrive at [[Jorenn Village]]
