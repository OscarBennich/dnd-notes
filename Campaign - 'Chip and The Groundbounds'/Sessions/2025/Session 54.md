**Next steps**
1. Continue travelling to [[Lyrengorn]]
	- Go north out of [[Westruun]], on the *Blackvalley Path* until we get to [[Jorenn Village]]. We then continue north, passing [[Umbra Hills]], continuing through [[The Grey Valley]] and the *Cliffkeep Mountains* until we get to Lyrengorn.
2. On the way there, I should read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and [[The Abyss]] for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
3. Open questions regarding [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath|Orcus]]:
	- Apparently Orcus was imprisoned with a druidic ritual in [[Shadebarrow]]
	- But the timeline currently doesn't make sense seeing as the druids should have been dead even before the battle of [[Umbra Hills]] drew Orcus' attention? But maybe *other* druids went back there and performed the ritual later?
	- We could try to ask [[Keyleth]] about [[Shadebarrow]] and Orcus?
---
- We pick back up as we've just finished the [[Sanguine Square Skirmish]] and won our prize - the [[Cloak of Protection]]
- I take the cloak and put it on
- [[Korren]] comes up and congratulates us
- We head to [[The Empty Pail]] and see [[Bumblesworth Shitterton]]
- Korren asks us about what other fights we've been in before
- They've been to [[Umbra Hills]] many times before, protecting people as they harvest [[Shadegrass]]
- Chip asks them about [[Eiselcross]]
- Narissa goes over to a table to deal cards for a card game with the goal of [[Bumblesworth Shitterton]] losing the deed to the tavern
- We play a dice game üé≤
- With some help from Narissa, Shitterton managed to lose the deed
- Shitterton will meet us in the morning to tell us more about [[Umbra Hills]]
- I see [[Korren]] go up to [[Narissa]] and begin flirting
- They head to Korren's camp
- We all take a long rest...
- We wake up and move down to have breakfast at [[Quell Souprise]]
- [[Narissa]] comes back from Korren's camp
- [[Bumblesworth Shitterton]] walks through the doors, chipper and relieved
- Shitterton is specifically interested in the demonic aspect of the battle of [[Umbra Hills]]
	- During the battle, when it looked like Trist Drassig‚Äôs forces were about to be overwhelmed, he made a pact with Graz‚Äôzt the Demon Prince of Indulgence - pledging his service in exchange for the power to win. The bargain accepted, demonic forces were sent but ultimately both demon lord and king fell.
	- ‚ÄúHe actually joined Trist Drassig on the battlefield, but both the Human King and the Demon Prince were defeated in the end, and Graz‚Äôzt was banished back to the Abyss.‚Äù
	- Victory came at a cost when the release of terrible energies exploded across the battlefield. The valley to the north was left cursed and lifeless, a warning against dealing with demons, and a ruined place where dangerous entities are drawn to.
	- Danger still lurks within the [[Umbra Hills]] and [[The Grey Valley]]. Undead soldiers rise from the grass when Catha is high, and the ruins of ancient Drassig war camps seem to draw demons of all types, still bound by the contract between Trist Drassig and the Demon Prince of Indulgence. Pathetic Dretches gambol about in the ruins‚Äô long shadows and rumours say that on nights where Ruidus is full even Balor demons prowl the hills and the valley beyond searching for mighty souls¬†to¬†corrupt.
- The demons here are believed to be remainders of the original demon troops, but it now seems that the veil between the planes has been weakened so demons can continue to cross over from [[The Abyss]]
- The demons mostly stay around this area ([[Umbra Hills]] and [[The Grey Valley]])
- There are rumors that [[Graz‚Äôzt the Demon Prince of Pleasure]] *himself* crossed over to the Material Plane. It's probably the pact with [[Trist Drassig]] that allowed Graz'zt to do this.
- It seems some details in [[A History of Tal‚ÄôDorei]] are slightly wrong:
	1. [[Neminar Drassig]] made some kind of pact with [[Bane the Strife Emperor]] and created an undead army.
	2. Later on, [[Trist Drassig]] made a pact with [[Graz‚Äôzt the Demon Prince of Pleasure]] (multiple different things point to him *specifically* being involved). *This* is what made the legions of demons appear, rather than the pact with [[Bane the Strife Emperor]]. The Bane pact seems to have just set the ball in motion.
	3. [[A History of Tal‚ÄôDorei#Chapter 10 The Battle of the Umbra Hills|The Battle of the Umbra Hills]] happens.
- [[Bumblesworth Shitterton]] thinks the mention of [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] in the history book is misleading and that he actually wasn't involved in [[The Scattered War]] (although his attention still seems to have been drawn because of the demonic involvement)
- Note: [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] is currently imprisoned in a pocket dimension and will have to be released through a ritual, [[Graz‚Äôzt the Demon Prince of Pleasure]] was free inside of [[The Abyss]] when he (in some way related to the Pact with [[Trist Drassig]]) was able to enter the material plane. So it is two different situations.

**Travel from [[Jorenn Village]] to [[Lyrengorn]], day 1**
- We head out of [[Jorenn Village]] and begin to head north
- My [[Patron]] tells me to tell [[Mads]] that regarding the person that she and her spoke of, a witch in [[Lyrengorn]] might be able to help
- We see a sign pointing to [[Kran and Gloup's Mount' and Lodge]] and after being persuaded by [[Dain]] we start heading there
- We are greeted by a receptionist (Kran) that knows [[Dain]] very well from before - "It's been years"
- They have a problem with *Chain Devils* that were summoned by a guest that they haven't been able to get rid off. These devils are now locked in a room because they didn't know what to do.
	- There are 3 of them
	- As a reward we would get the [[Inescapable Lash]] (+1 Whip)
- We come up with a plan:
	1. Gloup will open the door to the room where the devils are in.
	2. As he does that I will attempt to cast *Sickening Radiance* in the room.
	3. Close the door again and leave the devils to die from exhaustion.
- We go to the room
- I roll bad initiative (2) and the Devils get to go first
- As the first on hits me I use my *Misty Escape* to disappear and the other two try to push against Gloup to get out of the room, but fail
- On my turn I cast *Sickening Radiance* in the room and yell to Gloup to close the door
	- After failing six saving throws (DC 17 CON), they will automatically die from the 6 levels of exhaustion
- We open the door and the devils are gone, vanished to their home plain
- We get the [[Inescapable Lash]] as a reward from Gloup & Kran
- After some discussion we decide to leave (and [[Dain]] not being allowed to split from the party), and start heading off, soon reaching [[Umbra Hills]]
- Narissa attempt to pick up any [[Shadegrass]] we pass by
- During the late afternoon, [[Mads]] spots three small, strange-looking demons up ahead (a *Dretch*?)
- Mads casts *Pass without Trace* and we attempt to sneak pass them
- Narissa rolls a Nat 1...
- We manage to sneak passed them anyway
- Later in the evening, we see more roaming groups of these demons
- They seem more like animals (livestock/cows/reindeer) rather than something intelligent
- As the night falls we set up camp under a stone outcropping close to a mountain in the area
- Narissa reads the *Threads of the Pale Loom* book that we took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s lab in [[Westruun]]. In it she finds more information about the [[Matron of Ravens]].
	- Interesting note for [[Narissa]]: though the author herself is a High Warden of the Coven of the Veil in [[Vasselheim]], [[Exandria]]‚Äôs religious centre, she seems somewhat skeptical of the establishment she has encountered there. Many texts, histories and references to the Raven Queen are tinted with dislike, and sometimes even disgust. ‚ÄúHow dare a mortal deem themselves worthy to walk among our precious gods!‚Äù It‚Äôs almost as if other religious scholars and leaders over the centuries think she‚Äôs just an uppity oik who got too big for her boots. Their disapproval is somewhat understandable - after her ascension there was chaos with copycats popping up and causing trouble everywhere.
	- There is no mention of the [[Claret Orders]] in this book - in fact it‚Äôs much more of a scholarly text reviewing other literature on the¬†Raven¬†Queen.
- I also read through the books we picked up from Dragomir's lab but am not able to get any new, *specific*, information (we already knew Dragomir was looking into Druids, [[The Abyss]], and necromancy)
- We take a long rest...

**Travel from [[Jorenn Village]] to [[Lyrengorn]], day 2**
- The next day we set off again and it's a freezing day. It begins to rain üåßÔ∏è
- We're now halfway though [[Umbra Hills]]
- We set up camp but because of the cold we need to make a fire this time or risk exhaustion
- [[Chip]] comes up with the idea to stack rocks in front of the fire and make a pit to make the fire less visible
- [[Ossian]] casts *Bigby's Hand* and uses it to lift rocks
- We take another long rest...

**Travel from [[Jorenn Village]] to [[Lyrengorn]], day 3**
- The next day is another freezing day.
- As we prepare to set up camp, we spot another group of demons in the distance but manage to stealthily avoid them (w/ *Pass without Trace*)
- Suddenly, [[Mads]] hears [[Keyleth]]'s voice in her head (using *Sending*). She asks her where we are and Mads tells her we're in [[Umbra Hills]].
- Chip notices an eagle in the sky
- Ossian casts *Invisibility* on Chip and he flies up to check on the eagle
- The eagle flies down to our camp and transforms back into [[Keyleth]]
- We ask Keyleth about [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] and [[Shadebarrow]]
	- The [[Druids of the Dawn Circle]] assisted by casting *Sunlight* on the undead armies, killing them. After doing this, they retreated to [[Shadebarrow]] and that's where [[Trist Drassig]] killed later killed them as revenge (this was *before* the [[A History of Tal‚ÄôDorei#Chapter 10 The Battle of the Umbra Hills|The Battle of the Umbra Hills]]).
	- The cruelty of the killing and the demon activity around [[Umbra Hills]] sparked the interest of Orcus.
	- Keyleth tells us that some magic leaves an impact on the land. The murder of the druids *corrupted* Shadebarrow (with the help of Orcus). Orcus wanted to use this corruption to tear a rift between the material plane and [[The Abyss]] which would allow his demon armies to come through and invade our world.
	- A group of clerics and druids (apparently including Aarakocra!) from around the area performed the ritual to lock Orcus away in a pocket dimension, deep below [[Shadebarrow]] (the Aarakocra are definitely connected to the monastery that raised [[Chip]]).
	- Keyleth doesn't know any specifics about the actual ritual itself but will try to find out more information by travelling to [[Faernw√´]] as she believes there's a chance they've written details down.
	- While there she will also talk to [[Eebah]] and try to bring her back to [[Westruun]] (dropping her off at [[Caliban House]]). Chip gives her a letter to take with her so they know Chip is safe and that Keyleth isn't a stranger.
	- She informs us that in 2 months, [[Ruidus]] will be at it's peak, which is an ill omen. There are theories that during that time, some magic is easier to cast. This is probably part of [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s plan.
	- Keyleth also tells us that there are other threats connected to [[Ruidus]] and [[Catha]] are going to be in solstice at the same time (which only happens every 100 years), this means she has less time to prioritize this and help us. She will send any help she can to us but her resources is spread thin, but she will do her best.
	- I ask her if she can help us with [[Dragomir Lunthak]], [[Eiselcross]], and the [[Planar Scythe]] but she thinks it's a better plan to simply wait and meet up with him as he comes back from [[Wildemount]]. If too many people are looking for him, he might be spooked and change his plans, which would be bad. "Trust the plan" she says.
- After talking to us for a while longer, Keyleth transforms back into an eagle and flies away
- The session ends...
