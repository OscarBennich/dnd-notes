**Next steps**
1. Continue travelling to [[Lyrengorn]]
	- Go north out of [[Westruun]], on the *Blackvalley Path* until we get to [[Jorenn Village]]. We then continue north, passing [[Umbra Hills]], continuing through *The Grey Valley* and the *Cliffkeep Mountains* until we get to Lyrengorn.
2. On the way there, I should read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and The Abyss for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
3. Open questions regarding [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath|Orcus]]:
	- Apparently Orcus was imprisoned with a druidic ritual in [[Shadebarrow]]
	- But the timeline currently doesn't make sense seeing as the druids should have been dead even before the battle of [[Umbra Hills]] drew Orcus' attention? But maybe *other* druids went back there and performed the ritual later?
	- We could try to ask [[Keyleth]] about [[Shadebarrow]] and Orcus?
