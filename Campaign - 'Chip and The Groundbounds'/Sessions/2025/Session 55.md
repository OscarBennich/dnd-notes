**Next steps**
1. Continue travelling to [[Lyrengorn]]
	- Go north out of [[Westruun]], on the *Blackvalley Path* until we get to [[Jorenn Village]]. We then continue north, passing [[Umbra Hills]], continuing through [[The Gray Valley]] and the *Cliffkeep Mountains* until we get to Lyrengorn.
---
- We pick back up as [[Keyleth]] leaves our camp (the end of day 3)
- We gather around the fire, [[Chip]] talks about [[Eebah]] and the monastery. He also talks about one of the monks, *Coorg Mendel*.
- We take a long rest...
- Ossian dreams of our camp on fire and [[The Gray Valley]]. Premonition?
- The campfire has suddenly gone out
- Ossian tries to cast *Prestidigitation*, but nothing happens
- Chip tries to light the fire with a piece of flint, but nothing happens
- Chip tries to sense if there's a change in the "atmosphere" but senses nothing specific
- Mads casts *Speak with Plants* on a nearby tuft of [[Shadegrass]]
- Chip tries to light the fire with the piece of flint again, this time it works
- But Ossian's magic still doesn't work
- They wake the rest of us up
- I try to cast *Prestidigitation* to create a spark, and it works
- So it's Ossian's magic specifically?
- Ossian tries casting *Ray of Frost* ➡️ It works
- Ossian tries casting *Firebolt* ➡️ It fails
- So it's Ossian's fire magic that has been disrupted...? Is that connected to his dreams.
- I cast *Detect Magic* and make an Arcana check ➡️ Nat 20
- I see a thread going from me to another world
- I look at Ossian and see a similar tendril, but wrapped in golden flame, barely noticeable
- I don't see these threads for the rest of the party
- Are these the threads from [[Narissa]]'s dream?
- I've seen the golden flame when I viewed Ossian's dream with [[Queen Titania of the Summer Court]]
	- See: the [[Burning Vale]]
- Ossian made a choice: *Master the Tempest*
- [LIST OTHER CHOICES HERE]
- I ask Titania if this is her doing, she says "No. I just put him in touch with the right people..."
	- What does that mean?
	- This is def. referring to [[Lady Elmenore the Unforgiving]]?
- It is Lady Elmenore putting Ossian through this even if Titania is a kind of go-between
- I ask Titania if this doesn't interfere with her plans to stop Orcus, she responds with "I want a *stable* magic user in the final fight..."
- Whatever will cause the change in Ossian is not under Titania's control but rather Lady Elmenore
- We can't do much more tonight, so we go to bed
- We take a long rest...

**Travel from [[Jorenn Village]] to [[Lyrengorn]], day 4**
- An uneventful day
- We are still in the [[Umbra Hills]], getting closer to [[The Gray Valley]]
- Ossian is keeping an extra eye out for the location from his dream
- Ossian's fire magic still doesn't work
- There's an unsettling atmosphere
- Towards the late afternoon we reach the mountain pass between the [[Umbra Hills]] and [[The Gray Valley]]
- As the evening comes, we begin looking for a place to rest
- There is a place close to the mouth of a cave, but it looks similar to the place Ossian dreamed of
- The cave seems unnaturally dark, almost like fog
- Narissa shines a lantern in there but it doesn't seem to help much
- Ossian does an Arcana check but it doesn't seem to be a *spell* per se
- [[Chip]] does a perception check and notices a small marking on the mouth of the cave
	- The marking looks like a flame
	- Is this part of Ossian's trial?
- Ossian tries to contact [[Lady Elmenore the Unforgiving]] ➡️ WIS saving throw ➡️ Nat 1
- Ossian feels like a hook is dragging him into the cave, compelling him into the cave. Suddenly he vanishes into the "mist"
- As he does, we all follow him
- The cave is much bigger than it seemed and a thin corridor extends ahead of us
- As we do, fires on the walls start lighting up. Red, yellow, gold.
- One of the golden flames blocks Ossian's path
- A figure mad of fire appears, a man, [[Garris]]
- Everyone makes a WIS saving throw ➡️ We all fail ➡️ We're all wreathed in flame and *Paralyzed*
- Ossian makes a WIS saving throw ➡️ He fails as well
- Garris: "You lost control of your magic and you left me to die"
- Ossian is *Frightened*
- Two more humanoid figures made out of flames appear next to us
- The session ends...
