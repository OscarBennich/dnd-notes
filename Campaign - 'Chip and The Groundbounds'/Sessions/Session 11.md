---
- We start off discussing what our next move will be
	- Make traps?
- We decide to set up camp a little further away and then have 2 people keep watch closer to the griphon nest
- First shift is uneventful
- [[Chip]] sees two figures getting up over the edge of the mountain drop
- The 2 figures lower ropes and 3 more figures come up the mountain
- We see them planning on attack the griphons, we intervene!
**Combat âš”**

- A talking bat shows up...?
- The bat turns invisible and disappears
- As I hit it, its form changes and it looks like some kind of arachnid imp. As it dies it turns into black sludge (ichor)
- [[Narissa]] loots one of the bodies and finds an "elven blade"
- One of the [[Griphon]]s attacks Narissa and [[Theo]]
- As we all run away (with one of the bad guys paralyzed and being flown by Chip), one of the griphons follows us and tries to attack us
- We finally manage to run away as Theo distracts the griphon
- Mads desummons Theo and the griphon loses interest and goes back to the nest
	- We made it!
- Mads and Dain go back to loot the bodies near the bodies near the griphons (both are invisible)
- The rest of us start interrogating the poacher
- He says they are working for the "demon thing"
- "Glenn" was the one who met him
- Mads finds a bad with a black void in it. [[Bag of Holding]]?
- Dain finds 50g and an ornately carved box (it's empty)
- Mads inspects the black sludge left by the "demon thing"
- I interrogate Barry but I don't really find out much more
- I cast _Identify_ on the bag that [[Mads]] found
	- It _is_ a [[Bag of Holding]]!
- Barry says he doesn't know much
- He said he was recruited in [[Stilben]] by his friend Glenn
- He said he didn't know what exactly they were recruited to do
- I get a sense that he's lying about most  (or parts) of ther story
- The blade Narissa found was [[Windsong]]
- Chip searches Barry and finds a diary
- There's two letters stuck in the back
- The letters are from his wife, she doesn't want anything to do with Barry
- Barry is pissed off now it seems, he's no longer cooperating
- We all decide to take a rest
- Chip flies to investigate the camp at the end of the rope that the poachers used to get up to the griffon nest
- He finds nothing of interest
- Me and [[Dain]] finish a long rest and are no longer exhausted
- We see the griffon start circling around the area
- We decide to move way and make camp for the night a bit further away
- We will start heading back to [[Zephrah]] the next morning
- The session ends...
