- Last session Mads challenged the half-orc champion...
- Mads enters the fighting ring and starts fighting [[Heledd]]

**Combat âš”**

* Heledd barely wins the duel
* [[Thana]] comes up and starts speaking to [[Dain]]
* Heledd gives [[Mads]] a rock that glows in the sun
* Dain asks Thana about the [[Herd of Storms|herd]]
* Thana and Dain go to sleep
* [[Narissa]] dreams about the man (ghost) we saw in the ruins before
	* Before he is hanged, Narissa hears a female voice in her head
	* She wakes up and sees a raven sitting next to her
	* It flies off
* Narissa gets out of bed and walks around
* As she comes back, she sees a small figure approaching Mads tent
	* It's a small Gnoll - a child?
	* Narissa catches the Gnoll
* Thana is sitting close by and smoking a pipe
* She asks Narissa to let the Gnoll go
* Narissa agrees and joins her by lighting a cigarette
* [[Thana]]:
	* "Be careful"
	* "A lot of strange activity"
	* "Skeletons - undead activity"
* Narissa tells Thana about the ruins and the ghost ([[Session 14]])
* We all take a long rest
* In the morning, [[Chip]] asks around the camp about [[Find the magical storm|storms]]
* He talks to *Corbis*
* I buy 6 rations

**Day 11**
- Uneventful
- We set up camp on a hill
- We take a long rest

**Day 12**
- We come across several small hamlets
- People taking their fishing boats out
- Chip flies over the water and catches a fish
- I make a stupid "stone face" joke to [[Bethen]]
	- She punches me...
- Narissa shares a cigarette with Bethen
- I ask Ossian for help with blowing out their cigarettes
	- He uses *Prestidigitation*
- On the horizon we start seeing [[Drynna]]
	- We have arrived!
- Some of us head to the general store
- Apparently there has been [[Help with taking care of the the creature(s) who have been attacking fishermen in Drynna|issues with creatures attacking fishermen]]
- I hear the sound of angry voices near the [[Old Speckled Hen]]
	- A man is arguing with a woman
	- His name is *Gareth*
	- The woman has pale green eyes, red hair, and an *interesting necklace*
	- I intervene
- I cast *Charm Person*
- I convince the guy to leave us alone
- Her name is [[Juliette]]
- There's been a lot of crimes
- Chunks of [[Whitestone (rock)]] found in the lake
- You have to go deep underwater to find it
- This has lead to an increase in mercenary activity in Drynna
- Juliette tells us about Drynna and then heads off to go to the [[Bombardier's Well]]
- I think she's stolen my gold (Nat 1) and rush after her
- I enter the inn and look for her
- [[Zorth]] points to Juliette in the back
- I confront her but it turns out I was wrong all along
- Out of embarassment I buy Juliette a bottle of wine
- I then leave, passing a laughing Narissa on my way out
- The session ends...
