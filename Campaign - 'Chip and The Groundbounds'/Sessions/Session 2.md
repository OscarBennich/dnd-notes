---
- We headed north for a day
- Day 2 we encountered the "[[Chuul|lobster monsters]]" on the beach (they're actually called "Chuuls")
- We fought two of them (!) at the same time
- After a long fight, unfortunately [[Dain]] died a heroic death, being crushed by a Chuul (RIP ðŸ’€)
- After killing the Chuuls we found:
	- 2 large amethysts (worth 100g each)
	- 1 Nightcap that gives you pleasant dreams
	- 1 [[Gray Bag of Tricks]]
	- 1 Oolor Root (worth ~ 300g)

- We need to [[Find a way to resurrect Dain]]!
