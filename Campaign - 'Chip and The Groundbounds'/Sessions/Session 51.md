**Next steps**
1. Start travelling to [[Lyrengorn]]
	- Go north out of [[Westruun]], on the *Blackvalley Path* until we get to [[Jorenn Village]]. We then continue north, passing [[Umbra Hills]], continuing through *The Grey Valley* and the *Cliffkeep Mountains* until we get to Lyrengorn.
2. On the way there, I should read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and The Abyss for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
3. Open questions regarding Orcus:
	- When, where, how, and why was he imprisoned in this pocket dimension? And by whom?
	- Why *exactly* is it related to [[Shadebarrow]]? Was it there it happened?
