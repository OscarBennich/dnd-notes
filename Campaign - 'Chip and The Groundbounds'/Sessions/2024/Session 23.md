- "*Fondness for undeath and alliances with interesting allies*"
- The [[Luella the Dawnstealer]] is familiar with [[Mads]] father?
- [[Perron]] kills the Hag, takes the soul bag and walks off
- She opens the bag and releases the souls...
- On the Hag's body we find:
	- A strange metal bar
	- Bloodied cloth (bandages)
	- 2 small orbs
	- A ring
	- 212 Platinum
	- 953 Gold
	- 7500 Silver
	- 700 Copper
	- A locket made of gold
	- Small ornate hand mirror
	- Gem-encrusted hair brush
	- A small shriveled dried heart
	- A silk scarf
- I cast *Detect Magic*
	- The ring, the rod, the orbs, the bloody cloth, and the shriveled heart are magic
- The name of the hag was *Luella the Dawn-Stealer*
- The soul bag was "tied" to Luella?
- I identify the magical items:
	- *[[Wraps of Dyamak]]*
	- *Beads of Force* (x2)
	- *[Immovable Rod](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4662-immovable-rod)*
	- *[Ring of Protection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4726-ring-of-protection)*
	- *[[Luella the Dawnstealer's Heartstone]]*
- How did the Hag know Mads' father?
- The Hag seems to have been some type of fiend
- Mads never knew her parents
- I dream of my [[Patron]] in the Feywild
- She had lost her connection to me while the Hag was in control, but now she is back
- She is upset that she lost her connection
- The session ends...
