- The [[Big Ball]] is in 4 days
- We go to the [[The Saddled Plainscow]] tavern
- The barkeep is listening in on us?
	- I mentioned [[The Clasp]]
- The tavern is affiliated with The Clasp
- We head to [[Doom Bar]] and keep an eye out for anyone following us
- We get to Doom Bar and manage to lose someone following us
- [[Meg Ruddlestone]] is there
- The barkeep hands us a note that contains Thieves Cant symbols
- Meg can read it
- The first symbol means "parlay" but she can't read the rest
- We wait for [[Chip]], [[Narissa]], and [[Ossian]]
- We decide to play a dice game: [[Threes a Crowd]]
- The rest comes back
- Narissa translates the note:
	- "Parlay"
	- "Market ward"
	- "this way"
	- "meet at midnight"
- After a long discussion we head to the Market Ward
- We shouldn't mention [[Billiam Christ]] or [[John Christ]]
- We start looking for Thieves Cant symbols on the way
- See: [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]]
- The session ends...
