We find ourselves in [[The Crooked Gnome]], a tavern in the village of [[Mudchute]]. My sister, [[Narissa]], has gotten in trouble with the locals and I'm here to help her.

Our entire party has been contacted by the mysterious [[Madame Saunton]], who runs the tavern. Everyone (including [[Narissa]]) owes her in one way or another which is the reason we're here.

[[Madame Saunton]] wants us to go to the small island of [[Derwent]] off the coast of [[Mudchute]] to retrieve 3 items:
- A silver figurine
- A [[Driftglobe]]
- A magical scroll

[[Madame Saunton]]'s right hand man (woman) [[Mads]] will accompany us on her behalf.

We started out by going and talking to a fisherman to try to gather more information. We were told that the island might be haunted and that it has been owned by the same family for a long time.

To be able to get there we eventually agree to pay a fisherman 50g (I paid half) to avoid further fighting. We later realized this was **a lot** of money for this...

Once we got closer to [[Derwent|the island]] we could see that there was a big tower next to the estate with what looked like a telescope attached. Could it be an observatory?

Throughout the house we encountered traps, puzzles, and monsters ([[Mimic]], [[Living Rug]]). Dain picked up a considerable amount of money:
- 28 Copper
- 41 Silver
- 68 Gold
- 6 Platinum

I also learned more about the [[Feywild]] from a book I found. I learned that elves stem from there. I also learned that a city has traveled between the planes.

At the end of the adventure in the estate house we were confronted by the Wizard that owns all the items we had taken. He teleported in just as we were about to leave. We realized that we were much too weak to fight him but through some persuasion we got to keep two of the three items to bring back to [[Madame Saunton]].

We ended up being able to walk back to [[Mudchute]] as the tides were out. Even though it was muddy and rough terrain, we managed.

Once we got back to Mudchute we went back to the tavern and spoke with Madame Saunton and gave her the two items. After explaining the situation and why we didn't have all three she was understanding and let us know that all our debts to her are now paid.

We finished the day by drinking at the tavern while I used my newly acquired magical wand ([[Wand of Conducting]]) to produce some soothing background music.
