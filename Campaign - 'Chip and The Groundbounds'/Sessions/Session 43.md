- Chip makes a nature check to tell if the Dragon is aggressive
- I roll a Nat 1 for my death saving throw (2 failures)
- There is a force field being activated around the court yard, it will be shut off after next round (round 2). 
- And the house ([[Margrave's Keep]]) is being shuttered. We need to get inside!
- I make an Arcana check to see if the Dragon is from this plane
- Narissa gets a Crossbow from a guard inside the house
- End of round 2: the doors and shutters close, we are now out of combat (we all got inside)
- The statue of [[Palest Westruun]] from the Opal Ward has been activated as an animated Golem / guardian
	- (see [[Session 37]])
	- It is coming to fight the Dragon in the courtyard
	- The Golem is immune to all the Dragon's attacks
- [[Lysandra Kalloss]] wants to get outside to help, but she is being held back
- The rest are cowering further into the house
- Shouts of "What's going on?!", "Where did it come from??"
- Lysandra turns to the captain of the guards - "What's happening?"
- After a little while, we hear the sounds of the Dragon crashing to the ground. The Golem has defeated it! 🎉 
---
- The captain of the guards flips a magical switch and the shutters and door begin to open
- We exit the keep
- We see the Dragon lying dead on the ground
- The Golem is standing next to it - still activated - holding a sword
- [[Honor Kinnabari]] is still alive! She managed to run away as the Dragon was focused on the Golem
- Dain heals honor for 8hp
- As we look at it, the Dragon's body suddenly disappears
- [[Narissa]] investigates what remains on the ground around the Dragon (scales etc.) - roll 25
	- She tries to scrape some blood into a vial
	- She also *sneakily* tries to steal some dragon scales - everyone is too distracted anyway
	- But the *Gnome Advisor* to [[Lysandra Kalloss]] sees her (who is he exactly?)
- [[Honor Kinnabari]] limps forward
	- I ask her if she would know anything about what could conjure something so powerful
	- Seeing as she is a [[Spellwright]]...
- The person who cast the fireworks is form [[Westhall Academy]]
	- He is being questioned by the guards
	- Insight check: He seems honest, he is nervous. He doesn't know how this happened
- A human woman in blue and white robes who is referred to as "Head Mistress" by the caster of the fireworks - [[Dominic]]
	- Dressed nicely
	- Clip in her hair
	- Mid 60's
	- She is called [[Headmistress Estella Ladimar]]
- She tells Dominic that they will be able to prove his innocence
	- Insight check (7): She seems genuinely shaken
- Nobles are running home
- Artisans are hurriedly taking down all their things
- [[Billiam Christ]] is talking to [[Zenor]] and [[Mary Magdalene]]
- A woman in her early 60's, functional clothing, shows up
	- History check (Nat 20): She is called [[Lynne Serafine]]
- Lynne goes over to [[Lysandra Kalloss]]
- Lynne tells Lysandra that the attack is isolated to only this part of the city, most of the city is unaware. But rumor will spread quickly.
- [[The Shields]] will go out en masse into the city to calm people down
- Quest: [[Investigate the Dragon attack at the Big Ball]] 🆕
- After ~ 10 minutes, most people have left the courtyard
- [[Lysandra Kalloss]] comes up to us:
	- "Thank you for your support"
	- "I'm very grateful for your quick thinking"
- Evan: "Who would have wanted to attack this party?"
- Lysandra: "It will be investigated"
- [[Finley Merrymeat]] comes up to us
- Finley watches things very closely and has done so during the entire evening
- This is more or less the first time he's spoken
- The people who are left in the courtyard:
	- [[Lysandra Kalloss]]
	- [[Finley Merrymeat]]
	- [[Rynn Dalbrick]]
	- [[Lynne Serafine]]
	- [[Leoryl Velan]]
	- [[Lord William Thadwick III]]
	- [[Asif Valeron]]
	- [[Illvara Tevric]]
	- [[Thorn Valestrike]]
	- Guards from [[The Shields]]
	- [[Zenor]]
- [[Mads]] and [[Chip]] leave to track whoever left the scrap of paper
- The rest of us stay behind
- Listening to the [[Council of Westruun]] talking
	- The city is safe (for now)
	- [[Asif Valeron]]: "We need better protection"
	- [[Illvara Tevric]]: "We need to investigate the source of this"
	- [[Lord William Thadwick III]]: "I agree, it is unacceptable. We surely need to accept the proposal that we have been discussing."
	- [[Leoryl Velan]]: "I agree. I won't feel safe walking home. It is indeed highly disturbing."
	- [[Lysandra Kalloss]]: "No one would disagree that this was disturbing. I will be sure to make sure [[The Shields]] do their best in investigating this and get the support they need."
	- [[Lynne Serafine]]: "The Shields aren't as capable as they should be. They lack the magical capabilities of some guests for example."
	- [[Lysandra Kalloss]]: "We lost 8 guards."
	- [[Lynne Serafine]]: "I second Asif's point. We should accept the contract from [[The League of Miracles]]."
	- [[Asif Valeron]]: "I agree! Yes, it will be expensive. But we have the money."
	- [[Thorn Valestrike]]: "The money was going to go to restoring the Underwalk."
- What exactly is this proposal from The League?
	- Ask [[Zenor]]
- [[Dain]] goes over and casts *Mend* on the fountain in the middle of the courtyard
- We are asked to leave the courtyard so we leave
- [[Mads]] and [[Chip]] start trying to track whoever left the scrap of paper
	- See [[Investigate the Dragon attack at the Big Ball]]
- The session ends...
