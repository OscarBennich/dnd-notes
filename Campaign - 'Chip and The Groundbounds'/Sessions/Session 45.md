- We are now level 9! ðŸŽ‰
- Potential next steps:
	1. Go to the [[Herbalist shop]] in [[Westruun]] to investigate ([[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]])
	2. Infiltrate the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]] ([[Find a connection between The League of Miracles and The Clasp]]) and see if we can find evidence of [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s "disgusting experiments"
		- We now also know that [[Mads]] is the long-lost daughter of [[Dragomir Lunthak]] & [[Lila Lunthak]] ([[Session 44]]), so maybe we can use that angle?
		- If these experiments are directly to blame for Mads becoming a Tiefling, what could that be? A deal with a devil? Is this somehow connected to [[Ryzzix]] as well?
	3. Try to talk to my Patron and see if I can confirm that she is actually [[Queen Titania]] and what she wants from me ([[Find out who my Patron is and what she wants]])
	4. Head to [[Lyrengorn]] ([[Find answers in Lyrengorn]]), north of Westruun
	5. Find [[Shadebarrow]] ([[Main Quest - Investigate Shadebarrow]])
		- Find [[Meg Ruddlestone]] and talk to her
