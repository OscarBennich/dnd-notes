- We are now level 9! ðŸŽ‰
	- I now have *Seeming*, *Hold Monster*, and *Gift of the Protectors*
**Potential next steps**
1. Go to the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] in [[Westruun]] to investigate ([[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]])
2. Infiltrate the [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]] ([[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp]]) and see if we can find evidence of [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s "disgusting experiments"
	- We now also know that [[Mads]] is the long-lost daughter of [[Dragomir Lunthak]] & [[Lila Lunthak]] ([[Session 44]]), so maybe we can use that angle?
	- If these experiments are directly to blame for Mads becoming a Tiefling, what could that be? A deal with a devil? Is this somehow connected to [[Ryzzix]] as well?
3. Try to talk to my Patron and see if I can confirm that she is actually [[Queen Titania]] and what she wants from me ([[Find out who my Patron is and what she wants]])
4. Head to [[Lyrengorn]] ([[Find answers in Lyrengorn]]), north of Westruun
5. Find [[Shadebarrow]] ([[Main Quest - Investigate Shadebarrow]])
	- Find [[Meg Ruddlestone]] and talk to her
---
- We pick back up with [[Dain]] realizing that [[Mads]] is the daughter of the Lunthak's
- (I'm still at the [[Cobalt Reserve]])
- Mads is obviously upset about these news
- The party heads to a dingy bar to talk about this
- [[Chip]] pukes because of the smell ðŸ¤®
- Dain carries Chip
- The bar is called [[The Old Peculiar]]
- The bartender is a sad-looking, young (almost child-like) human
- Mads orders a bottle of whiskey (or something similar) - it's vile
- This is the worst thing Chip has ever tasted
- Chip ends up projectile vomiting (failed a CON save) on the table
- Mads takes her bottle and leaves the bar...
- The child bartender cleans up Chip with a dirty rag (another CON save)
- [[Ossian]] uses his spice pouch to make the whiskey taste slightly better for Dain
- Chip heads to [[Monk's Eternal]] for a meditation session
- Ossian is following Narissa who is following Mads
- Dain heads to a brothel to "cheer himself up"
	- [[Bessie's Best]]
	- [[The Anointing]]
	- [[Pigs in Blankets]] ðŸ‘ˆ
	- [[The Missing Sausage]]
- Mads goes all the way to the edge of [[The Bramblewood]], outside of Westruun
- She starts riding [[Theo]]
- They head into the woods
- [[Narissa]] tries to track them (*Survival Check*, 6), she risks getting lost in the woods so she decides to stay at the edge

> We all have parental abandonment issues (except Dain who has nice parents)

- Mads and Theo find a spot in the forest, stop, and talk
- Theo: "You were created? I was created."
- Mads: "I was hoping whoever my parents were would miss me..."
- Theo: "I would miss you ðŸ˜”"
- Theo: "I don't like this man. Can I eat him?"
- Mads takes a drunken nap against a tree with Theo protecting her
- Mads feels safe in the forest, compared to the city
- Meanwhile, Ossian catch up to Narissa at the edge of [[The Bramblewood]]
- Narissa: "I know where I am"

> Harshal: "If you have a garlic enema you can't get fucked by a Vampire"

- Meanwhile, back to Evan at the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
	- See [[Find out who my Patron is and what she wants]]
- I head to [[Doom Bar]], but there's no one there
	- I head to the Underwalk instead
- Meanwhile, Chip is having a meditation session at [[Monk's Eternal]], he's now cleaned up
- [[Mads]] starts heading out of the woods
- Narissa and Ossian are still at the edge of the woods
- They meet up. Mads is obviously drained.
- The three of them start heading back to [[Doom Bar]]
- I also head there and meet [[Chip]]
- We hug ðŸ¥°
- Chip tells me about Dragomir and Mads
- Dain is still at the brothel
- The 5 of us meet up in mine and Chip's room
- The hag said she knows Mads' father
- There was mist around the hag, and apparently mist around [[Shadebarrow]] - is that connected?
- They ask me what I've been up to
- I try to lie but it doesn't go well
- I end up telling them everything
- [[Queen Titania]] speak to me in my head: "Good plan, bad execution"
- Mads crash on our bed

- Everyone goes to bed, long rest ðŸ˜´
- We wake up and meet downstairs
- Dain is back
- We discuss what to do next
- **Patron decision** (3/3): "I think we should *all* do the plans together"
- We decide to start with looking into the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]] ([[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]])
- First, we go to [[Gilmore's Glorious Goods]] and pick up Mads new armor - [[Mads' Black Dragon Scale Mail]]
- Narissa, Chip, and I will go scout during the day and then we will all try to break in during the night
- I cast *Seeming* on the three of us
- Chip and me are disguised as two 50-something female, human, twins:
	- "Agda Nilsson" (Chip) & "Greta Nilsson" (me)
- We're going to buy a leather apron as a 50th birthday present from me to Chip
- We head to the shop through the city
- I cast *Detect Magic* (10min) before going inside
- We go inside, Chip makes a perception check (22)
	- There's a door behind the counter
	- It doesn't look like it would be hard to break into
- History check (21): [[Austell]] previously described that they had living quarters connected to the store. It's all on the same floor.
- There's other people inside that are talking to the shopkeeper
- I sense magic behind the door, unknown exactly what
- I also sense magic from the medallion worn by [[Tristan Stonesworn]]
	- Arcana check (24), *Transmutation* magic. It is a magical key
	- The magic is similar to that of the warehouse we broke into in [[Drynna]]
- The people at the counter leave
- His medallion has the symbol of [[Erathis the Lawbearer]]
- We talk to Tristan
- Chip asks him about "upstairs" - that seems like a bad idea (*Insight* check, 23). He seems uncomfortable with our questions.
- He is closely observing us
- As we leave, he is writing something down
- Meanwhile, Narissa is scouting the building
- The three of us start heading back to [[Doom Bar]]
- Chip and I are immediately being followed by 2 people
- Me and Chip head to [[Seven Brothers]] and go into a bathroom together and lock ourselves in there
- We soon hear banging on the door
- I cast *Dimension Door* to teleport us to an alley 500ft away
- I drop the *Seeming* spell

- We plan to break into the leatherworking store during the night
