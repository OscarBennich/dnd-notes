- We all go to [[Best Stitch Tailoring]] in the Market Ward
- We all order clothes for the [[Big Ball]]
- We all decide to head to the [[Westruun - Temple of Matron of Ravens]] so [[Narissa]] can have another vision
- The temple doesn't show the same thing to Narissa like before. Now it's just a normal building without the sacrificial basin etc.
- My [[Patron]] speaks to me - *"Be seeing me soon"*
- We decide to head to the [[Cobalt Reserve]] to do research

	- She remembers being taught magic by someone whose name she cannot remember
	- The name of the mortal that became the [[Matron of Ravens]] was wiped from texts and memories
	- When she ascended she destroyed the previous god of death
	- A follower and partner of the previous god of death?
	- Many people have tried to repeat her ritual that she used to ascend - [[Ritual of Seeding]]
	- No one succeeded until recently when the Arch-lich [[Vecna]] ascended to become [[The Whispered One]]
- Matron champions:
	- *Pervan Suul* - Champiomn during [[The Calamity]]. Had a wolf companion called "Galdric"
	- *Vax'ildan* - Part of [[Vox Machina]]. Fought and defeated [[Vecna]], sealing him beyond [[The Divine Gate]]. Fought on behalf of the Matron. Brought back to life. Rumor that he ferries mortals to the afterlife. Relationship with [[Keyleth]].
- We find out some city state has been developing a magical weapon to use against other cities
	- This was during the *Age of Arcanum*
	- Could the monster in the [[Chianfanelli Bank]] be connected to this?
