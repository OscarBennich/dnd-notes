**Day 6**
- We are starting to descend. In the very distance we see a lake
- To the east of us we see the ocean
- We make camp before getting to the edge of the mountain
- The night passes uneventfully

**Day 7**
- We begin our journey out of the mountains
- We all risk sliding down the mountain (DEX check)
- We finally get out of the mountains and get to the plains
- As the evening approaches we start seeing a structure (building) on a hill to the east
- It seems to be the ruins of a small fortress. Abandoned?
- We head towards the hill to make camp
- Mads looks for a cellar but doesn't find any
- In the courtyard [[Narissa]] finds a kind of "platform" (almost like a stage)
- Based on [[Dain]]'s knowledge of stones he can sense that this structure is *very* old
	- Pre-calamity?
- [[Mads]] looks for tracks, finds no human tracks. Just wilderness and expected animal tracks
- [[Chip]] tries to dig into the "platform" in the courtyard. He finds nothing of importance
- I cast *Detect Magic* and walk around but see nothing
- **During the night Chip dreams of his younger self**
- As Narissa keeps watch she feels a cold wind a hears whispers
- In one of the rooms to the north Narissa sees a spectral person. Ghost?
- It is pacing around and mumbling to itself
- Narissa sneaks closer to look at the specter. It doesn't notice her
- It is an elven man. He is wringing his hands nervously
- Narissa picks up a small rock and throws it close to him to try to get his attention
	- He doesn't seem to notice
- Narissa wakes me up
- I wake Mads up
- Narissa goes up to the ghost and touches it, her hands passes right through it. I follow Narissa
- The ghost suddenly stops pacing, falls to his knees and clutches his face, obviously distressed
- The ghost is dragged from his kneeling position and his hands are bound by something I cannot see. He then starts walking towards the courtyard
- He moves directly on top of the mound. He then begins to scream in absolute terror and gets gagged
- He starts ascending invisible stairs and then suddenly drops as he's hanged
	- We all make WIS saving throws
	- Narissa, Ossian, Mads, and Theo failed, they start suffocating
- We grab the people who are suffocating and run out of the ruins. They can breathe again!
- We move away and make up camp
- In the morning, the ghost disappears
- In the morning we go back to the ruins. No more suffocating!
- We investigate the gallows, no signs of anything
- We write a warning on the wall and leave:
	- *"Danger \n Ghost at night"*

**Day 8**
- Uneventful day
- Narissa is worried about the whispers and the ghost. I try talking to her about it.
- We set up camp. It is more exposed here on the plains. We are starting to feel the heat now as we are coming down from the mountains.

**Day 9**
- A carriage on it's side blocks our path
- Transporting statues?
- We move in to investigate
- Chip sneaks closer to the carriage. She sees two sets of glowing eyes under the carriage
