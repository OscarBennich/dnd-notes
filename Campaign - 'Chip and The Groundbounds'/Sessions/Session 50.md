**Next steps**
1. Decide what to do with Dragomir...
	- Let him go to [[Eiselcross]] and intercept him on the way back?
	- Try to arrest him and interrogate him?
	- Let Mads play along (for now)?
	- Convince him to stop what he's doing and turn on whoever else is involved? Something like:
		- We know what you've been doing Dragomir... The experiments in your underground lab, The *Planar Scythe*, trying to release Orcus onto this plane. We can't let you continue. 
		  
		  If you tell us everything you know and turn yourself in to The Shields, I promise you we will do everything in our power to help you get a reduced sentence. If not for yourself, do it for the sake of your long-lost daughter, Dragomir. For Mads and for Lila.
2. Read through the books I took from [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s secret lab about Necromancy, Druids, and The Abyss for any clues regarding his exact plans or connections to other things going on
3. Figure out more about what the exact meaning of the [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp|text we found]] (written by Dragomir): "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the Planar Scythe. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the Shadow That Was.*" (dated ~ 2 days ago)
	- What is "the Planar Scythe"? Is it a weapon?
		- Maybe it's something that allows creatures to cross into different planes...?
	- What is the bargain they made with Luella?
	- Releasing the *Shadow That Was* - That is probably referring to [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] as my [[Patron]] said that Dragomir is trying to "release" him
	- Maybe we could find out more at the [[Cobalt Reserve]]
4. Find out more information about [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]
	- See [[Help Titania stop Dragomir from releasing Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]

- We resume in Dragomir's house...
- Chip makes an insight check ➡️ Nat 20 (+7)
- Chip feels a breeze pass him, it smells like sulphur
- Chip hears a quiet "clacking" sound, quickly before it stops
- Chip uses his *Titania's Pocket of Nonsense* to be able to see invisible creatures
	- He sees a familiar figure - it's [[Ryzzix]]!
- Chip grapples Ryzzix but he turns in to a centipede and slips away
- Chip grapples him again and tries to put him/it into his pouch
	- "Let me go!" Ryzzix screams
- Suddenly he disappears again (Misty Step or something?)
- [[Dragomir Lunthak]] comes back in the room but Chip convinces him everything is fine
- He leaves again to finish the tea
- He comes back into the room
- [[Ryzzix]] turns out to be Dragomir's familiar
- Mads: "What did you do to make me this way?"
- Dragomir:
	- I first learned of Shadebarrow from the cousin of my wife
	- It seemed like a historical curiosity to me
	- It is a wound on the world
	- I dreamt of a woman in a swamp that could give me answers ([[Luella the Dawnstealer]])
		- She said that immense power was locked in [[Shadebarrow]]
		- Power to protect those I love
		- Be granted eternal life
	- Orcus is a being of immense power but I'm not "handing him the world"
	- Maybe you think I've lost my way, and maybe I've had. But I'm no monster.
	- I started this because I wanted to keep something, I lost both you (Mads) and Lila.
	- I seek to preserve myself...
- Dragomir puts his cup down and walks over to the window, hands behind his back
- He explains that he didn't always have this wealth. "I was born to be forgotten"
- His aunt - [[Calexa]] - taught him to read etc.
- She was special to him
- "Death is erasure, oblivion. I swore not to go out like that. I did it all so I would never disappear"
- He sits back down
- He doesn't believe [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]] is manipulating him
- "This is about me and those I love. Not the *world*"
- I do not seek to *release* him, I seek to *use* him.
- He wants to unshackle him for a moment, use him, then bind him again.
- "I do not seek destruction of the planet."
- Mads: "What happened with [[Janet]]?"
- Dragomir: "She walked into my lab at a bad time."
- He didn't kill her but his experiments did... (or so he argues at least)
- Dragomir made a deal with [[Luella the Dawnstealer]] to get more information about [[Shadebarrow]]. This is what lead to [[Mads]] becoming a Tiefling.
- We continue to argue...
- Dragomir: "I could have made you a goddess beside me." (to Mads)
- "Why should immortality be denied us?"
- "I wanted to understand what death really was - to master it."
- Dragomir: "The [[Planar Scythe]] opens portals to other planes"
- Chip: "Do you think everyone deserves to be immortal?"
	- What would you accomplish with that?
- Dragomir: "I have dreams, maybe helping others become immortal"
- Dragomir says he's heard enough (he's convinced we will never believe him to be anything but evil)
- In response, Mads reaches for her quiver...

---
- [[Dain]] casts *Locate Creature* but is unable to locate Dragomir
- The room (and house) is going up in flames from the fire that started on the couch🔥
- Dain casts *Major Image* to conjure an image of giant flame on the roof
- I try to help get buckets of water to put out the flames
- Some heroic citizens are also starting to help out
- [[The Shields]] join us too
- With everyone helping out, we finally manage to put out the flames
- Ossian rolls for *Wild Magic Surge* but nothing happens (current DC ➡️ 6)
- As [[The Shields]] start asking questions we chose to leave
- [[Jeremiah]] tells them about us
- I drop *Seeming* and Mads casts *Pass Without Trace*
- Stealth check ➡️ We all succeed
- We head back to [[Caliban House]] and are greeted by [[Perdita Thimblegrin Quickgleem (Grinny)]]
- [[Usko]] makes us a meal
- We start discussing what to do next and how to travel to [[Lyrengorn]]
- We can either take the long way around (safer) or the shorter way (more dangerous)
- Longer way: Go west out of [[Westruun]], past the *Silvercut Crossroads*, then north on the *Wildwood Byway* until we get to [[Kraghammer]]. Then continue north past [[Terrah]] until we get to Lyrengorn.
- Shorter way: Go north out of [[Westruun]], on the *Blackvalley Path* until we get to [[Jorenn Village]]. We then continue north, passing [[Umbra Hills]], continuing through *The Grey Valley* and the *Cliffkeep Mountains* until we get to Lyrengorn.
- We choose to take the shorter way, it should take us at most **28 days**
- We stock up on rations for the travel ahead and buy healing potions from [[Gilmore's Glorious Goods]]:
	- 3x *Potion of Healing*
	- 2x *Potion of Healing (Greater)*
- We send a letter to [[Billiam Christ]] and tell him about what happened with Dragomir
- We also send a letter to [[Meg Ruddlestone]] telling her about our plan to go to [[Lyrengorn]] and that we will meet up with her in [[Westruun]] before going to [[Shadebarrow]] (in ~ 2 months time)
- I go to the [[Cobalt Reserve]] to try to find out more information about:
	- [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath]]
	- [[Aeor]] and the [[Planar Scythe]]
- I find out more information about Orcus but there's almost nothing about Aeor and nothing about the Planar Scythe
- But I'm told I can make a special request to a Cobalt Soul library in [[Wildemount]] and they will send whatever information they have back to the [[Cobalt Reserve]] in [[Westruun]]
	- I'll read whatever they've sent when we're back in [[Westruun]] later
- The session ends...
