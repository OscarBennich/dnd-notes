**Next steps**
- (1) Talk to [[Honor Kinnabari]] at [[B√§kerz Bakery]] in Westruun
	- Convince her to help us uncover the collusion between [[The League of Miracles]] and [[The Clasp]]
	- Ask her about the details of the contact between The League and [[Council of Westruun]]
	- Ask her about the attack by the Magma Landsharks - when was this? Could The League be behind this attack as well?
	- Ask her if she has any ideas about the exact motivation behind the collusion between The League and The Clasp. *Why* is The League of Miracles paying The Clasp?
- (2) Find the deed that is missing from the [[Hall of Reason]] - hopefully confirming that The League are co-signers with [[Tristan Stonesworn]]
	- This together with the ledger and the dumbwaiter leading to the Clasp facility "upstairs" should be enough evidence of their collusion
- (3) Find a way to decipher the letter we found in the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]
