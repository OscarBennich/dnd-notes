> - [[Find evidence of collusion between The League of Miracles and The Clasp]]

---
**Next steps**
- (1) Talk to [[Honor Kinnabari]] at [[B√§kerz Bakery]] in Westruun
	- Convince her to help us uncover the collusion between [[The League of Miracles]] and [[The Clasp]]
	- Ask her about the details of the contact between The League and [[Council of Westruun]]
	- Ask her about the attack by the Magma Landsharks - when was this? Could The League be behind this attack as well?
	- Ask her if she has any ideas about the exact motivation behind the collusion between The League and The Clasp. *Why* is The League of Miracles paying The Clasp?
- (2) Find the deed that is missing from the [[Hall of Reason]] - hopefully confirming that The League are co-signers with [[Tristan Stonesworn]]
	- This together with the ledger and the dumbwaiter leading to the Clasp facility "upstairs" should be enough evidence of their collusion
- (3) Find a way to decipher the letter we found in the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]
- ‚ùó **Reminder** ‚ùó Remember to use my "Gift of the Protectors" invocation by writing 4 names in my tome

> "A jam sandwich is not a soup!" - Lotta

- We've written these names in my *Book of Shadows* now (protected from being downed):
	- Evan
	- Ossian
	- Mads
	- Chip
- We start heading to [[B√§kerz Bakery]]
- [[Honor Kinnabari]] is standing outside the bakery
- [[Ansel B√§ker]]'s mother is manning the counter - [[Linda B√§ker]]
- We grab something to eat and head to a park to be able to speak more privately
- I insist on paying even though Linda wanted to give it to us for free (Persuasion check ‚û° 28)
- We start explaining the situation to [[Honor Kinnabari]]
- Persuasion check from Narissa ‚û° 16
- Honor: Dragomir takes all kinds of strange shipments for the League
- Honor wanted to be able to give out spells for free but someone in [[The League of Miracles]] insisted on taking money for it
- Skyport contract?
- Honor: Lots of people are in the league for their own reasons, [[Dragomir Lunthak]] seems to be in it to gain access to things he otherwise wouldn't have
- Dragomir's assistant: [[Ashcombe Paltimore]] 
- People usually contact Dragomir for high-price contracts - we wouldn't really be able to get into contact with him without rousing suspicion
- The Magma Landshark attacks where a few months ago
	- So this could also have been staged like the other attacks...
- Increased attacks and crime rates in and around the city
	- The Clasp is probably behind this (together with The League)
- It's not uncommon for The League to back deals like the one to buy the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]], so leaving that paper trail wouldn't necessarily be strange
- Honor can get us into [[The Offices of The League of Miracles]] and we should do it right away because [[Dragomir Lunthak]] and [[Ashcombe Paltimore]] are both out for the day
- I cast *Seeming* and we all look like the characters from the D&D Movie
- We take a short rest (let me reset my spell slots) and start heading to the offices
- We enter the offices and are greeted by [[Cecilia Brightwater]]
	- [[Honor Kinnabari]] hates her
- She asks for our names:
	- *Jarnathan*
	- *Chris Pine*
	- *Holga Kilgore*
	- *Doric*
	- *Xenk Yendar*
	- *Bradley Cooper*
- We call our party "Deeanddeemoviegang" (D&D Movie Gang)
- [[Chip]] asks Cecilia about the interior of the building and fills out a complaint form
- Honor leads us down a corridor
- Along it are paintings detailing the destruction and reconstruction of Westruun
- We reach the end of the corridor
- The door on the left is [[Dragomir Lunthak]]'s, the one on the right is [[Ashcombe Paltimore]]'s
	- They're supposed to be gone for the rest of the afternoon (3 hours)
- Mads casts *Pass without Trace*
- [[Dain]] casts *Major Image* to make the corridor look empty (think Road Runner, Looney Tunes) while we wait for 10min for me to cast *Detect Magic* as a ritual
- Someone walks past but doesn't notice us
- After casting *Detect Magic* I don't sense magic on either of the doors, nor any magic behind them - lead doors?
- [[Narissa]] picks the door to Dragomir's office
	- As she turns the knob, spores explode in our face
	- We all need to make a CON saving throw
		- Chip and Narissa are *poisoned* for the next hour
- Chip: *"Ouchie, ouchie, ow, ow. I don't feel so good...*
- We open the door and see a large sturdy desk in the middle of the room, a crystal chandelier in the ceiling. Shelves line the room.
- We enter the office and start investigating
- We find a letter from [[Bognor Regis]] that is complaining about the destruction wrought by the *creature from [[Aeor]]* (the [[Nullifier]] from the bank)
- We also find a letter from [[Walter Leyton-Beasly]] informing [[Dragomir Lunthak]] about delays to the [[Residuum]] shipments
- Narissa finds a latch in one of the drawers
	- We find the deed to the [[Herbalist shop (now leatherworking store)]]!
	- It's signed by Dragomir Lunthak
	- The smoking gun!! üî•üî•
	- We put it in our [[Bag of Holding]]
- Narissa also finds a book called "*The Craftsmanship of an Agreement*" by [[Donaldus Trumpus]] in one of the book shelves
	- It's slightly tilted
	- Can this be used to decipher the letter we found?
	- We also take it and put it in our [[Bag of Holding]]
- Chip comes up with the idea to shift *all* books so Dragomir doesn't know what we stole
- There's a painting on the that depicts a halfling that is sitting on an alcove, reading a book called "*The Escapades of Hilora Bramblesong*"
	- She's called [[Hilora Bramblesong]] (history check) - known for her riddles
	- It is magic - *conjuration*
	- Is it like the living mirror in Snow White?
	- [[Dain]] makes a perception check - 21
	- Looking closer - we see one of the pages of the book she's reading, on it we see: 
		- "*The beginning of eternity, the end of time and place. Either side of every eve, the edge of every face.*"
	- It looks like the painting is following us with her eyes
	- Dain does a INT check - Nat 20!
		- The wording of the riddle is very specific, we need to pay attention to the words.
	- Beginning of eternity ‚û°Ô∏è e
	- End of time and place ‚û°Ô∏è e
	- Either side of every eve ‚û°Ô∏è e
	- The edge of every face ‚û°Ô∏è e
- Dain touches the "E" in the title of the book, he vanishes!
	- We all end up touching the "E". We all vanish...
- Dain arrives at the top of a staircase, behind him is a stone wall, a staircase leading down. Sconces burning with blue and green light.
- Chip appears. Then Mads. Then Ossian. Then Narissa and I.
- We follow the staircase.
	- A large room. Workbenches. Loads of bookshelves with materials and reagents. 
	- No windows. 
	- Is this where [[Dragomir Lunthak]] does his experiments?
	- We notice a *hum* of arcane energy and the stench of decay
	- On a large stone table in the center of the room are 3 massive humanoid figures...
	- A heavy necrotic presence is coming from them
- Chip feels sick - something isn't right here
- Narissa hears angry, discordant whispers
- I hear my patron, she disapproves
- Chip looks at some of the books, they seem to be books on a few of the things we've encountered:
	- Undead, Demons, Raven Queen, Druids, Rituals
	- And a discarded book on [[The Whispered One]] (*hint hint* üòâ) 
- One of the creatures on the table have a contraption over it's head which lightning crackling
- Narissa and Ossian are looking around
	- Empty crates with the [[The League of Miracles]] symbol on them
	- An eyeball encased in a gem
	- A glass jar of black pearls
	- Various spell components
	- A silver ritual knife that radiates a faint necrotic energy (150g)
	- As Ossian reaches for the eyeball - him and Narissa need to make a CON save
		- Ossian saves but Narissa is now poisoned for 2 hours and takes 34 points of damage
- Chip walks on a pressure plate and as he does the lightning in the machine crackles even more and a *Lightning Bolt* is cast on him
	- DEX save, 20, saved!
	- With *Evasion*, Chip takes no damage
- As that happens, the three creatures wake up..

- We did it! And the golems never got to attack üòà
- The flesh golems lie wasted on the floor... They are no longer a threat to us and we are free to investigate
- Narissa finds a note on the bench in the middle with information about the constructs
	- "*Use for protection force?*"
- Chip notices that one of the main work benches looks like where Dragomir keeps all his notes - he finds another button like the one in Dragomir's office
	- He presses it
- It contains a large pearl, shimmering unusually
- He also finds a leather-bound journal
	- There are entries that detail shipments
	- Mentions of [[Aeor]]ian artifacts
	- "*I believe the excavation team in [[Aeor]] is close to finding the [[Planar Scythe]]. The time has almost come to make use of the bargain with [[Luella the Dawnstealer|Luella]] and release the [[Orcus the Demon Prince of Undeath|Shadow That Was]].*"
- We also find a locket with a picture of a woman inside
	- An faded inscription - "To eternity, as one" and a soft blue cloth with the initials *M.L.* (Mads'?)
	- Mads makes a WIS check - 12...
	- She doesn't remember her mother or know if the picture is of her or not
- We also find a book called "The Codex of the Unspoken", it lies open
	- It seems to be about drawing energy from the Abyss to cast necromantic spells
- The session ends...
