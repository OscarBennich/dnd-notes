- [[Mads]] and [[Narissa]] sneak up on the orc woman on the roof
- The orc woman leap off the roof
- Afterwards they spot [[Hareth Valbardo]] in the [[Sunrise Lodge]]
- We head over to the lodge to ask about [[Ryzzix]]
- We ask the people about the Hydra, the dreams, and Ryzzix
- Hareth seems to freeze up when we mention the "other threat". Suspicious...
- The reason the [[Hydra]] talked *might* be the [[Whitestone (rock)]]/[[Residuum]] in the water
- We head back out to the square
- I use *Minor Illusion* to scream at Narissa to come down to us
- Narissa and Mads are pissed off at me...
- A caravan is leaving for [[Westruun]] in the morning in 3 days, via [[Turst Fields]]

**Speculation**
- The Hydra referred to evil power in [[Drynna]]
- Somehow "bought" Hareth or something (he's a politician so he has power)
- The same Evil power summoned Ryzzix?
---
- Me, Chip, Ossian, and Dain go to talk to Theodora from [[The League of Miracles]] about Ryzzix
- [[Walter Leyton-Beasly]] is speaking angrily to [[Tomos]] about using *Necromancy*
- [[Theodora]] doesn't really have more information
- Should we head to [[Westruun]] to find out more information about Ryzzix?
	- Go to the [[Cobalt Reserve]]?
- Mads and Narissa go to find the half-orc woman (her name is [[Perron]])
- They tell her about the Hydra and what it said
- She seems *intently interested*
- She's been tracking something for a while
- The bad dreams are familiar
- She suspects Hareth knows more...
- She tells Mads and Narissa to meet her at [[Yammer House]] after sundown (to spy on Hareth?)
- We reconvene at our hotel
- We decide to buy the [[Sending Stones]] and enchant Narissa's crossbow (+1)
	- Total cost = 1450g
