- We are now level 3! ðŸŽ‰
- [[Evan|I]] start heading back to the house to meet up with [[Chip]]
- I join [[Cubert Crantock]] and Chip and pick up a wine glass and play my [[Wand of Conducting]]
- Later in the evening I get contacted by my [[Patron]], telling me thing about a book and disappearing
- I try to hide my shock from Chip and Cubert but I think Chip noticed something
- The rest of the party head to the temple to [[Find a way to resurrect Dain|begin the ritual]]
- [[Dain]] is alive again! ðŸ¥³
- Dain, Mads, and Ossian decide to sleep at the temple
- Narissa is heading back to [[Kenwynn]]'s house
- Narissa tells me and Chip about the resurrection
- Me and Chip have some coffee to sober up
- We had to the jewelry store
- We managed to convince [[Hans Brask|the jeweler]] that we had nothing to do with the diamond robbery (or so we think at least)
- We head out the back and start heading to the [[Sunset Stride Inn]]
- We informed [[Father Mordec Vart]] that he is needed in the temple. He told us to come back after lunch (and we probably need more people than just me and Chip)
- We head back to the house and tell [[Narissa]] that we need more people to head to the tavern
- Me and Chip go to sleep
- The rest come back to the house from the [[Stilben - Temple of Avandra|temple]]. Narissa gave Dain his money that she took previously
- They all head to the tavern
- As I wake up from a dream about a meadow, the [[Patron|familiar voice]] screams "Weak up, Evan!" and a tome lands on my chest - my _[[Book of Shadows]]_
- Chip asked about the tome and I told him about all the visions etc.
- Chip suggested I try to speak to my patron and understand what she wants. I think this is a good idea
- After me and Chip had our little talk, we head to the [[Sunset Stride Inn]] to join the others
- Me and Chip are no longer _exhausted_ after having slept
- When we get to the tavern I see [[Dain]] is alive again and a sense of great relief washes over me as I simultaneously give him a hug. And Chip joins in too!
- We all start discussing who should do what in the tavern
