- We start with us being gathered in [[Kenwynn]]'s house after being attacked
- [[Mads]] has recovered from he illness
- We all go to bed...
- [[Chip]] dreams of a voice
	- [[Eebah]]?
- The others think Chip has died...
- [[Evan|I]] have a vision of the heist
- [[Patron|A voice]] speaks to me
- I recognize the voice from previous dreams
- The dream changes, I'm now on a street wrapped in mist
- I walk down the street
- The dream changes again...
- I'm now in a glade, I recognize this from when me and [[Narissa]] came to [[Westruun]]. I recognize this as a memory from when I was a young boy and desperately trying to learn magic. I sit in the glade and get a sense of peace.
- The dream ends...
- In the beginning of the dream I saw my old boss at [[The Ironhand Trading Company]]. He was watching [[Narissa]]. His name was [[Teath Ruddlestone]].
- [[Anton]] left us a note in the night. He has left to go sailing... (Melih went back to Turkey)
- Chip went and bought hair dye remove for [[Narissa]]
	- Narissa now has very blonde hair
- [[Evan|Me]] and [[Chip]] head to the magic item store ([[Philmore's Fabulous Freight]])
- [[Cubert Crantock]] applies makeup to [[Narissa]], [[Ossian]], and [[Mads]] (for the heist)
- I was charmed by [[Philmore]]
- Chip managed to get me out of the store before I bought anything
- We walked around for an hour
	- The charm spell wore off
	- I'm now aware that he attacked me
- I tried telling a guard... She didn't seem to care
- In my angry state I contemplate going back and charming him back
- I hear a [[Patron|familiar voice in my head]], she's encouraging me to go back to the store and attack Philmore
	- I barely resist the urge
- Me and Chip head back to Kenwynn's house
- Once we got back I told the rest of the gang about what happened at [[Philmore's Fabulous Freight]]
- I'm still very angry about the whole thing. The injustice is too much...
- Chip wanted to meditate with me
- The rest are planning [[Find a way to resurrect Dain|the heist]] more in detail
- The session ends with us leaving. The heist was a success!!
