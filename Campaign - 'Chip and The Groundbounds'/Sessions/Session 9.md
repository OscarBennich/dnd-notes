---
- We pick up with us in the darkness, having snuck past the harpies
- We find a cave with an overhang, perfect for a camp
- Dain and Ossian take first watch
- Me and Narissa take the second watch
- Narissa is **really** worried about what's happening to her - magic, death cult?
- Ossian dreams of [[Garris]], wreathed in flames
- Who is Garris?
- Chip and Mads 'bond' over being in the mountains
- Chip makes a flower crown
- *Day 5*:
	- We continue up the mountain
	- Mads seems paler than usual...?
	- A dark sky above us, rain starts. Difficult travel today. The winds and rain is battering us.
	- It's getting colder.
	- We find shelter to get away from the storm (in a cave)
	- Me, Chip, and Dain create **DISCO CAVE**
		- Disco ball
		- Drums
		- [[Wand of Conducting]]
		- Fireplace
		- Thaumaturgy âž¡ Lights, Bass
	- The bass seems to have dislodged some rocks... Potential rockslide?
	- Me and Chip take the last watch and reminisce about the **sick** Disco Cave ðŸ¤™
- *Day 6*:
	- We continue on...
	- Chip hunts down a rabbit
	- Towards the evening we see a ceiling of clouds
	- Our vision gets impaired by mists
	- We set up camp on a little plateau
	- Mads skins the rabbit to be able to cook it
	- Mads cooks an impromptu rabbit stew
	- The night passes by uneventfully
	- Ossian dreams again - "remember..."
- *Day 7*:
	- We continue on...
	- The weather is clear
	- We brake through the clouds and realize how high up we are
	- Chip sees a strange ruin at the side of the mountain. It's massive. Crumbling, stone walls, carved into the mountains
	- Chip hears a low voice in the wind as she flies closer
	- No one of us understand the language they are speaking
	- Dain runs off and me, Chip, Mads follow
	- Dain inspects the stone from the ruin, it's Dwarven in nature. It's long abandoned.
	- Behind the wall we hear voices, bickering
	- Out from behind the wall steps a **two-headed, gargantuan creature** - like a 2-headed ogre with a Battle-Axe and Morningstar

Dead!

* We know it is some kind of giantkin, with orcish features
* After the creature dies we listen for anything else but we don't hear anything
* I cast *Detect Magic* but I see nothing unusual
* We decide to set up camp in the old ruins
* Me and Ossian take the second watch
* We complete a long rest

* *Day 8*:
	* The morning greets us and we hear a robin chirping
	* We head off
	* **Mads skin tone has changed since we first met her. It's more gray than before**
		* Connected to the black sludge?
	* (Tieflings can come from a relative making a deal with a devil)
	* We keep walking
	* We see a structure
	* We see a large majestic tree with pink blossoms
	* We see two people using some kind of flying contraption. Kind of like wind surfing in the sky.
	* **We have arrived in [[Zephrah]]!**
	* There's quite a lot of Tieflings here
	* We talk to a little girl and I ask her about the town. She will show us the inn.
	* I follow her
	* We get to a structure with a painted roof
	* We meet [[Oswalt]], [[Ellis]], [[Gwen]], and [[Sai]]
	* To try to ease the tension with Gwen, I conjure a pink rabbit with *Minor Illusion*
		* It did not go great...
	* Gwen was actually a little child Tiefling. She had some kind of illusion, similar to what Mads had in Mudchute
	* Ellis says it's "Harvest's rise". It's the beginning of spring - "season of planting"

	* We approach the tree with the pink blossoms
	* There's 3 people standing beneath the tree
		* One woman, Half-Elf
		* One older man, Half-Elf
		* One man, Human
	* The woman makes a glowing portal appear in the tree and the human steps inside and disappears
	* The woman is the one they refer to as the "Voice of the Tempest"
	* Rift to the air plane close to the town. Could be issues with wind close to it.
	* The woman is called [[Keyleth]]
	* The [[Air Ashari]] protect the rift
	* [[Norris Bramlet]], Bowyer, Halfling
	* [[Rosavine]], Artificer, Tiefling
	* Join festivities connected to Harvest's rise?
	* Boom in population around Drynna?
