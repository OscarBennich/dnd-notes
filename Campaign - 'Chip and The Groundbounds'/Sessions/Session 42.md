- We are still at the [[Big Ball]]
- We try to whisper but end up drawing attention to ourselves

- These are the 3 main temples of [[Westruun]]
- Suddenly a trio of [[Matron of Ravens]] priestesses appear
- They also want to give their blessing, this is *highly unusual*
- One of them hold a very ominous speech:
	- *May the Matron guide us in our time of need,
	  May she comfort the weary wandering soul,
	  For chains that bind in shadow and greed,
	  Are breaking down below.
	  Darkness will fall upon these lands,
	  As those that slept now greet the moon,
	  The few must act as my hands, to cleanse the rot that feeds the storm*
- As they spoke their voice changed
- When they're done they seem staggered
- A direct message from the [[Matron of Ravens]] herself?
