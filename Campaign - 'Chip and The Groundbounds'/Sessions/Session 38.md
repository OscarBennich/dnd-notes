- We start in [[Doom Bar]]
- The [[Big Ball]] is in 4 days
- History check to find out where [[John Christ]] could be
- He is probably in the Underwalk
- As we leave for the Underwalk we are handed a note by the proprietor of [[Doom Bar]]
- The note is from [[Billiam Christ]] about [[Lila Lunthak]]
- Lila was born *Austen*
	- Same last name as [[Buddleah Austan]]
- We go to the Underwalk and look for John
- We go into the sewers
- We see two symbols on the wall with an arrow pointing left:
	- A rat
	- A tower
- We follow the symbols
- We are heading towards the Market ward (underground)
- We turn a corner and see [[John Christ]] being held up by his neck by a humanoid with a rats head
- It's a [[Wererat]]

	- 514g
	- 23s
	- 55c
	- Scroll of Sending (x1)
- We interrogate John (see [[Narissa is wanted for murder in Westruun]])
- We come to an agreement with John that we won't tell Billiam if he doesn't tell The Myriad about us
- John leaves the sewers
- I investigate on our way out
- We find two Thief's Cant symbols
- Narissa pushes on a stone and the wall moves away
- Behind the wall is a spiral staircase
- We move up it
- Above it is a kind of 2nd level
- It's kind of like a narrow corridor with a metal grate above us, with sky over that
	- It seems like a sewage canal
- We are still under the Market Ward
- [[Chip]] tries to stealthily slide the grate away and check where we are
- We are in a dark alley behind a crate
- In front of us is a sign that is hanging outside some kind of tavern
- Chip goes up and looks at the tavern sign (with *Invisibility*)
- The tavern is called [[The Saddled Plainscow]]
- He then tries to figure out exactly where we are
- If we get to the Market Ward he can then find his way back to the tavern
- Chip comes back to the sewers
- We go back down the sewers and keep walking
- We find another exit and eventually get out!
- (*I puke all over myself*)
- I lie about running after a pickpocket from the [[Friends of the Minack]] - deception check DC16
- The guards from [[The Shields]] leave us alone
- We end the session by going to a spa...
