- We are now level 5! ðŸŽ‰
- We are at the docks in [[Drynna]]
- [[Chip]] and I fish from the docks
- We catch a small fish!
- Chip eats it...
- We head over to [[Yammer House]]
- We meet up with [[Rita Underwood]]
- [[Dain]] DID make a sex dungeon for [[Walter Leyton-Beasly]]?
- Brawl in the fighting ring...
- We ask Rita about [[Ryzzix]] but she doesn't know anything
- [[Hareth Valbardo]] is more aggressive than usual?
- Did he have something to do with his [[Pauvren Valbardo|brother]]'s death?
	- To get on the council?
- Hareth's house is to the north of the river
- Rita wants us to investigate Hareth. He's acting suspicious
- Lots of weird dreams in Drynna. What does that mean?
- Me, Ossian, Narissa, and Dain head to [[Hareth Valbardo]]'s house
- As we get to the house I cast *Detect Magic*
	- I notice a glowing aura away from the house
- It turns out to be the half-orc from [[Yammer House]] (blue tattoos, green skin)
- She is also watching the house
- Meanwhile Chip and Dain are fishing
- [[Narissa]] decides to break into the house (picking the lock successfully)
- She doesn't find anything specific
- But it does seem like someone lives there currently (but Hareth is supposed to be at the [[Sunrise Lodge]])
- Narissa heads back to [[Yammer House]] to check if the orc is still there (are there two of them?)
- We all reconvene at the docks
- We take a long rest
- Mads is looking for a way to investigate [[Rita Underwood]] and [[Hareth Valbardo]] in the [[Sunrise Lodge]] - a nearby roof?
- Mads checks the notice board for anything new/changed
- "Tal'Dorei council"
- The orc lady from before is apparently also watching [[Sunrise Lodge|The Lodge]]
- Narissa and Mads decide to "join" the orc-lady on the rooftop she is standing on
- The session ends...
