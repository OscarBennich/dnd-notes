- A village in [[Exandria]], north of [[Westruun]]
- It's quite a large village (~2500 residents)
- Silver veins were discovered in the nearby hills
- Far enough from [[Emon]] that the Tal'Dorei council leaves it alone
	- Allows opportunists and outlaws to do what they want (more or less) - *similar to [[Stilben]] in that way*
- Slaves were used to mine the nearby mountain of [[Hainburg]] (to the west). You can still hear their screams at night.
- Older "city centre" with newer buildings further out
- 30 years ago, vigilante and outlaws became the protectors and call themselves the "[[The Shadewatch]]"
- There's a central square (*The Sanguine Square*) with buildings around it:
	- There's a modest inn: [[Quell Souprise]]
	- A dive bar / tavern: [[The Empty Pail]]
	- A general store: [[Frontier Provisions]]
	- Another store: [[Pack N' Whack]]
- There's also a notice board
