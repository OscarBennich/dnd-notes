The Battle of the Umbra Hills, which took place over the course of many days also left a mark on the region to the north of the [[Umbra hills]] - a wide valley of ill omen and dark history, named for the forest of petrified trees that fill the majority of the valley’s forest floor. This is the Grey Valley.

- A valley north west of [[Umbra Hills]]
- Related to [[The Scattered War]] and [[A History of Tal’Dorei#Chapter 10 The Battle of the Umbra Hills|the battle of Umbra Hills]]
- Infested with Demons from [[The Abyss]]
- Difficult to traverse and dangerous

Danger still lurks within the [[Umbra Hills]] and [[The Grey Valley]]. Undead soldiers rise from the grass when Catha is high, and the ruins of ancient Drassig war camps seem to draw demons of all types, still bound by the contract between Trist Drassig and the Demon Prince of Indulgence. Pathetic Dretches gambol about in the ruins’ long shadows and rumours say that on nights where Ruidus is full even Balor demons prowl the hills and the valley beyond searching for mighty souls to corrupt.
