*Shadebarrow was once a henge used as a ritual site for the sun-worshipping druids known as the Dawn Circle. Their shrine became their tomb after [[Trist Drassig]] slew them for aiding Zan Tal’Dorei in the Scattered War centuries ago. After Trist Drassig’s death the trade guilds of [[Westruun]] laid claim to the land, and from there the Dawn Circle’s abandoned and treasureless burial tunnels were purchased from the unions at great cost by an eccentric Westruunian baron named [[Sevil Howthess]]. Being obsessed with its history, he became interred there upon his death. The tomb is supposedly outfitted with protections, and with the remnants of his fortune.*

---
- No one has been to Shadebarrow for a long time
- Why was it lost to time? Strange...
- According to an early map we found, Shadebarrow should be somewhere east of [[Westruun]]

[[Session 44]]:
- [[Mother Veyra]]: A slaughter like this will leave a mark - it could attract undead to it, or other magical forces
- [[Dain]], [[Mads]], and [[Ossian]] ask [[Buddleah Austan]] about Shadebarrow
- At first she is noticeably uncomfortable but once Mads tell her that we're not looking for treasure but about the [[Find the magical storm|undead threat]], she changes her tune and has a look of recognition.
- She then tells us she has sent "quite a few" treasure seeking adventurers to their death / undeath
- [[Camilla Tenver]] gave up the location of the tomb to someone who then came back as an undead and killed their whole family
- This was 15-20 years ago
- After that they wanted to keep the location of Shadebarrow secret "forever"
- After a successful persuasion check (17), Buddleah agrees to tell them the location
- Mists surround the place
- We need to be able to navigate dense forests
- South of the road from [[Westruun]] to [[Turst Fields]]
- East of [[Westruun]]
- Not a lot of visible markers
- She gives us rough instructions...
- We need to travel down the *Silvercut Roadway* south for 5 days, and then east for 5 days
- We know we will have found it when we found the standing stones (henge stones)
