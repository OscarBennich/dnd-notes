*Shadebarrow was once a henge used as a ritual site for the sun-worshipping druids known as the Dawn Circle. Their shrine became their tomb after Trist Drassig slew them for aiding Zan Tal’Dorei in the Scattered War centuries ago. After Trist Drassig’s death the trade guilds of Westruun laid claim to the land, and from there the Dawn Circle’s abandoned and treasureless burial tunnels were purchased from the unions at great cost by an eccentric Westruunian baron named Sevil Howthess. Being obsessed with its history, he became interred there upon his death. The tomb is supposedly outfitted with protections, and with the remnants of his fortune.*

- No one has been to Shadebarrow for a long time
- Why was it lost to time? Strange...
- According to an early map we found, Shadebarrow should be somewhere east of [[Westruun]]
