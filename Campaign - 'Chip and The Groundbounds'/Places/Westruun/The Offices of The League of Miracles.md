- Looks like a manor house
- It is a free-standing, three-story, dark gray building with alleys on either side and a tall spike-tip iron fence that surrounds the building
- With only one gate at the front
- The bars on the windows has warding runes etched into them
- Fresco of a phoenix rising from the ashes of Westruun
- Sconces, dark mahogany, marble
- Everything is branded with the symbol of The League
- Black / Gold / Purple theme
- Red marble floors
- Mads: "Seems like a gaudy strip club"
