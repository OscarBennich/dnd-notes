From the *Threads of the Pale Loom* (see [[Session 54]]):

The Raven Queen, The Matron of Ravens, or simply The Matron, is the master of the skein of fate and the mistress of winter. She is the god of death. Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life, watching over the transition between life and death, and ensuring that the natural transition is undefiled.

Mourners at funerals across the land invoke her blessing in hopes that she will protect the deceased from the terrible curse of undeath.
**Depictions**
- There are very few visual depictions of the Matron of Ravens - many temples simply use a raven as a symbol of her blessing. Rare images, however, portray the Raven Queen herself as a tall, pale woman wrapped in dangling black linens, her onyx black hair straight and neverending, her face obscured by a white porcelain mask.

**Ascension**
- Keepers of ancient lore believe that the Matron of Ravens was once mortal herself, and thus the only known mortal to have ascended to godhood, at least until before Vecna, [[the Whispered One]] arose. Her rise instantly obliterated the previous, now forgotten, god of death and in the wake of her ascension the other gods quickly and fearfully destroyed the secrets to their own ancient rites of ascension - or at least that’s what the texts in [[Vasselheim]] tell us.
- They also tell of the many attempts at imitating the Raven Queen that followed. Reportedly an exceptional spellcaster, many a wizard and sorceress have tried to follow in her footsteps, but to no avail.
- Not only did her rise obliterate the name of the former god of death, it also obliterated her own mortal name. For names hold power and grant control to those who wish to use them for ill. Unlike the other gods in the pantheon, the Raven Queen remains nameless. 
- Many theories abound on the relationship between the Raven Queen and the former god of death. The consensus from various texts in [[Vasselheim]], a deeply religious (and, in some ways, puritanical) society seems to be that she was the god of death’s trusted apprentice. As a mortal she fostered the relationship between them, before finally managing to extract the secrets of ascension from him, before betraying him and taking his place.

**Holy Day**
- The Night of Ascension is the Raven Queen’s holy day. It celebrates her apotheosis. The actual date of the goddess’s rise to divinity is unclear, but the Night of Ascension is nevertheless celebrated on the 13th of Cuersaar. Many people of [[Emon]] see this cheery celebration of the dead to be unnerving and macabre, but the Matron’s followers believe that the honoured dead would rather be venerated with cheer than misery. The Raven Queen is also considered by some to be the patron of Winter’s Crest, a holiday that celebrates freedom from Errevon the Rimelord and coincides with the winter solstice on the 20th of Duscar.

**Commandments of the Raven Queen**
- Death is the natural end of life. Grieve the fallen but do not pity them. Exult in the time that they were granted on this plane of existence. The path of Fate is sacrosanct. Those who pridefully cast off destiny must be punished. Undeath is an atrocity. Death is too good a punishment for those who pervert the rightful transition of the soul.
- Though these are the commandments spread to the masses, the interactions with the Raven Queen have not always led this author to believe that these decrees are absolute. For instance, many clerics of the Raven Queen are granted some necromantic powers themselves. A clear distinction however, is that these powers are not used to build vast undead armies, but rather stop that very kind of thing.
- Additionally, clerics of the Raven Queen (perhaps not my colleagues in Vasselheim, but many others), have successfully restored souls to their bodies through resurrection ceremonies. This seems to either suggest that if the thread of Fate is cut too early, then even natural deaths can be reversed, or that, once again, the teachings are perhaps not as absolute in practice as they are in theory. 
- Each church needs its pillars, so it is not this author’s ambition to entirely undermine the teachings which she herself holds so dear. This is however a nuanced point for a more informed reader - the threads of fate weave together, but that does not mean that all is predetermined.
