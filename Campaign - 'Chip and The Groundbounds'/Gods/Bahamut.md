Bahamut was the dragon god of justice and a subservient deity to Torm, god of law. Before entering the Faer√ªnian pantheon, he was a member of the Draconic pantheon, as a deity of good dragons, metallic dragons, wisdom, and enlightened justice (justice tempered with mercy and punishment with forgiveness) known by the name of Xymor. For some time, he was also a member of the Untheric pantheon, under the alias of Marduk.

His natural form was that of a platinum dragon, said by many to be the only one of his kind. He was also the eternal rival of his sister Tiamat, queen of the chromatic dragons.
